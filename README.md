Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based communications platform that combines different services for collaboration, such as chat, meetings, calling, and files. Teams is tightly integrated into Microsoft 365 and combines multiple workloads into a unified communication and collaboration system. In addition, Teams offers integration capabilities for other tools and third-party products.
