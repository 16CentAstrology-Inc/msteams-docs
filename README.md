## Microsoft Teams docset/repo

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.For Microsoft Teams docset/repo see [docset/repo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/mstdd-landing/).

## How to contribute 

Teams documentation is part of the Microsoft Docs technical documentation library. The content is organized into groups called docsets, each representing a group of related documents managed as a single entity. Articles in the same docset have the same URL path extension after docs.microsoft.com. For example, /docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/... is the beginning of the Teams docset file path. Teams articles are written in Markdown syntax and hosted on GitHub.

Several of the Microsoft documentation sets are open source and hosted on GitHub. Not all document sets are completely open source but many have public-facing repos where you can make suggested changes via pull requests. For more information see [Microsoft Docs contributor guide overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/).

** Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**
    CLA bot is a good guideline for the distinction between "small" and "large" contributions. PRs that do not require the CLA to be signed are likely "small." PRs that do require the CLA are likely "large."
