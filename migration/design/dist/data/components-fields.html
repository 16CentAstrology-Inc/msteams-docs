    <h1>
        Fields
    </h1>
    <p>
        Fields are areas where users can input text. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Padding and size
            </h4>
            <p>
                Single-line text fields are a fixed height of 32px to match the height of other components. Some text fields such as description fields may be taller vertically to allow more text.
            </p>

            <h4>
                States
            </h4>
            <p>
                These are the states of our text fields. Text fields exist in different states. We have specific designs dedicated to nine possible scenarios, including (top to bottom): Resting text field, Keyboard in focus and cursor inside the field, Keyboard in focus with text entered, Error handling has succeeded, Error handling has failed, Clear text field (including an X icon), Search field (including a Search icon), Loading field, and a Disabled field.

            <h4>
                Formatting help text and labels
            </h4>
            <p>
                Fields can contain placeholder text to give an example of the kind of information that is required. They can also hold labels that give the user more context. Within a field, your text should always be justified left. We use sentence casing throughout here, as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We use Segoe UI Regular at 12 pt (caption) and $app-gray-02 for labels. For help text, we use Segoe UI Regular at 14 pt (base) and $app-gray-02.

    <h1>
        Flyouts
    </h1>
    <p>
        Flyouts are more lightweight than dialogs and can be dismissed quickly. They can contain buttons, fields, and other components.

                Sizing and padding
            </h4>
            <p>
                We recommend a 16px padding to the left and right of the content.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Placement
            </h4>
            <p>
                Flyouts are contextual and should be placed above, below, or beside the element that triggered it.
            </p>

            <h4>

            <p>
                The header remains in place to give context to the content being scrolled.
