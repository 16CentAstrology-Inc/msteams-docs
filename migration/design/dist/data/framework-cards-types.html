        Types of cards
    </h1>
    <p>
        Some cards are best used to present standalone or individual pieces of content. We designed the following <a href="#hero">hero</a>,  <a href="#thumbnail">thumbnail</a>, and <a href="#sign-in">sign on</a> cards for that purpose. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a name="hero"></a>
            <h4>Hero</h4>
            <p>
                Our largest card. Best used for articles, long descriptions, or scenarios where your image is telling most of the story.
            </p>
            <div class="image-frame">
                <img src="../images/framework/framework_cards_hero.png" />
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a name="thumbnail"></a>
            <h4>Thumbnail</h4>
            <p>
                Short and sweet. These cards are ideal for short answers, or if you want to return several cards at once so the user can choose from a bunch of options. We think these are a great way to deep link to another tab or a web service.

            <div class="image-frame">
                <img src="../images/framework/framework_cards_thumbnail.png" />
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a name="sign-in"></a>
            <h4>Sign in</h4>
            <p>
                Some services require users to sign in independently of our authentication. In that event, you would present a sign-in card before the user can connect to your service.

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <p>
                    Limit the occurrences of an additional sign-in card since they pose a significant speed bump for new users.
