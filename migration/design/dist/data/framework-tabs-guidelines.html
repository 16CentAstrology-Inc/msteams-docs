        Guidelines
    </h1>
    <p>
        A good tab should display the following characteristics: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Focused functionality</h4>
            <p>Tabs work best when they’re built to address a specific need. Focus on a small set of tasks or a subset of data that’s relevant to the channel the tab is in. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Reduced chrome</h4>
            <p>Avoid creating multiple panels in a tab, adding layers of navigation, or requiring users to scroll both vertically and horizontally in one tab. In other words, try not to have tabs in your tab.</p>
        </li>

            <h4>Integration</h4>
            <p>Find ways to notify users about tab activity by posting cards to a conversation, for example.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Conversational</h4>
            <p>Find a way to facilitate conversation around a tab. This ensures that conversations center on the content, data, or process at hand. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Streamlined access</h4>
            <p>Make sure you’re granting access to the right people at the right time. Keeping your sign-in process simple will avoid creating barriers to contribution and collaboration. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Personality</h4>
            <p>Your tab canvas presents a good opportunity to brand your experience. Incorporate your own logos, colors, and layouts to communicate personality. </p>
            <p>
                Your logo is an important part of your identity and a connection with your users. So be sure to include it.
