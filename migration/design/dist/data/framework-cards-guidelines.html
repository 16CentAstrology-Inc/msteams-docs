    <p>
        Think of a card as a response to a user question or a setting. A card can respond to a direct question (like, “How many open bugs do I have?”) or to a condition (like, “Send a list of my open bugs at 9 am every day”). 
    </p>

        <p>
            Using one of our standard card types means you’ll already know that all your responses will render nicely across each supported platform. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A card could include any of the following elements: 
    </p>
    <div class="two-column-layout">
        <div class="column-right">
            <img src="../images/framework/framework_cards_anatomy.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="column-left">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Envelope text</h4>
                    <p>Best used for chat messages. For example, if you want a bot to say: “Here’s what I found!” or “Time for your 1:00 news digest”, that message is best displayed in envelope text. </p>
                    <p>
                        Envelope text is a great way to inject a little personality into your service—just remember to keep it relatively short. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Title</h4>
                    <p>Your title will always be the largest text in your card. It also serves as your “hook”, so try to keep the title short, memorable, and easy to scan. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Subtitle</h4>
                    <p>Best used for attribution, taglines, or as a secondary directive. This component appears just below your title. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Image</h4>
                    <p>Images scale to fit their container. Hero cards have a max width of 420px, thumbnails have a max width of 100px, and list views only allow for 32px in desktop mode. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Text</h4>
                    <p>Best used for plain text in the body of your card. Your max length depends on the card type you’ve selected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Buttons</h4>
                    <p>Best used to open web pages, tabs, or additional chat content. Make sure to keep your button text short and to the point. </p>
                    <p>
                        You can include up to 6 buttons per card, but we’d recommend following a ‘less is more’ philosophy here.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Tap region</h4>
                    <p>This is the clickable region of your card. Most users will want to click on images automatically, so try and craft your text so they know where they should tap or click. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            There’s no need to include every element in each card you create. Let your content dictate your elements.
