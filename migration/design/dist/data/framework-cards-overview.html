        Cards are actionable snippets of content that you can add to a conversation through a bot, a connector, or app. Using text, graphics, and buttons, cards allow you to communicate with an audience.

        Our card framework eliminates the burden of designing a fully functional UX. We developed several standard card types and each one fits within our supported platforms. This means layout is completely taken care of, and you wonâ€™t need to develop different card iterations across platforms. Instead, you can focus on dialing in your content.
