            <h4>Single canvas</h4>
            <p>This is one large area where work gets done. OneNote and Wiki follow this pattern. If you have an app that doesnâ€™t separate content into smaller components this would be a good fit.</p>

        <li>
            <img src="../images/framework/framework_tabs_illustration_list.png" />
            <h4>List</h4>
            <p>Lists are great for sorting and filtering large quantities of data and are great at keeping the most important things at the top. It is helpful to use sortable columns. Actions can be added to each list item under the ellipsis menu. </p>

            <img src="../images/framework/framework_tabs_illustration_columns.png" />
            <h4>Column</h4>
            <p>Columns are great for workflows that move an item from one column to another to indicate a new status. Consider supporting drag and drop for those scenarios. We recommend using dialogs or inline expansion for detail views.</p>

            <img src="../images/framework/framework_tabs_illustration_grid.png" />
            <h4>Grid</h4>
            <p>Grids are useful for showing elements which are highly visual. It helps to include a filter or search control at the top.</p>
