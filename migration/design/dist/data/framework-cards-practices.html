                Keep the noise down
            </h4>
            <p>
                It’s easy to send multiple cards into a conversation, but once cards scroll out of view, they become less useful. Try to limit yourself to the essentials. This is especially true in a channel where users have less tolerance for what they perceive as “noise”.

                Test on mobile
            </h4>
            <p>
                Mobile environments are space- and bandwidth-constrained, so be cautious about including oversized images and large data sets in lists and carousels. Also, title widths and text lengths will truncate on mobile, so that’s another thing to keep an eye on.

                Check your graphics
            </h4>
            <p>
                Graphics are going to scale, so be sure to preview them on all platforms.

            <h4>
                Avoid including text in a graphic
            </h4>
            <p>
                Anything that needs to be read by a user should be included in a text field. Once an image is dynamically scaled, any text you add to a graphic may become unintelligible.
