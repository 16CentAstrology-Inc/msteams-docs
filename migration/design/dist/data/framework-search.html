        The search function in Microsoft Teams presents a great opportunity to promote your app to users who might not discover it on their own. Once an app is added to a team, all team members will see it in search results. It'll be included even when it’s only a partial match. There's also a link from Search to "Discover apps" where anyone using Teams can find your app.

    <p>
        A search for your app will deliver the following components and information: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Your app name
            </h4>
            <p>
                Make it something short and memorable.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Your icon
            </h4>
            <p>
                We use your full-color square icon and apply rounded corners for apps, hexagonal shape for bots. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                A description
            </h4>
            <p>
                Provide one line of text that summarizes your app’s capabilities and gives initial directions about installation. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <p>
            Icons render at 32px in the search auto-suggest menu, so make sure your icon is clearly legible at that size.
