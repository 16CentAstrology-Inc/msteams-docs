                Always include a default state
            </h4>
            <p>
                Include a default state to make tabs easy to set up even if your tab is configurable.

                Deep linking
            </h4>
            <p>
                Whenever possible, cards and bots should deep link to richer data in a hosted tab. For example, a card may show a summary of bug data, but clicking it can shows the entire bug in a tab.

                Naming
            </h4>
            <p>
                In many cases, the name of your app may make a great tab name. But consider naming your tabs according to the functionality they provide.
