        What you’ll need 
    </h1>
    <p>
        Have your manifest and icons ready to go before you start the submission process. Your complete submission package should include two icons (20x20 outline icon, 96x96 full color icon), your app manifest, and up to five screen shots of your app.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>
        App manifest
    </h1>
    <p>
        Your manifest is the ledger that describes every component of your app while also providing the requisite specifications and commands. It must contain everything your app needs to function. If, for example, your manifest doesn’t contain specifications for your app settings menu, then your application ultimately won’t have a settings menu. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Your manifest should include the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Manifest version number
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is the version of the Microsoft Teams schema that your manifest will work with. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Your version number
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is the version of the app you’re submitting. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <div class="pro-tip">
            <p>
                Any future changes to your manifest should result in a version change, as well. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <li>
            <h4>
                ID
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is a unique identifier of your app. It must be a GUID.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h4>
                Package name
            </h4>
            <p>
                The name of your package should be the reverse of your domain name. For example, if your domain is myapp.example.com, your package name would be .com.example.myapp. Your max character length is 64.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h4>
                URLS
            </h4>
            <p>
                website URL, privacy URL, and terms of use or end user license agreement. All these elements are required.
            </p>
        </li>

            <h4>
                App name

            <p>
                You can provide both a short name (max character length 30) and a long name (max character length 100) for your app. The short name field is required. 
            </p>

            <h4>

            <p>
                Include both a short (max character length 80) and a long (max character length 4000) description of your app. Both fields are required, so if your app description is 80 characters or less, simply duplicate the same description in both fields.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Icons
            </h4>
            <p>
                Include two icons, one 96x96 full color icon and one 20x20 transparent outline. Your full color icon background should match your branded accent color. Submit both as PNGs.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Accent color
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is your branded app color. Define it by providing a hex value (beginning with ‘#’). Your app theme should match your app icon.

        Tabs
    </h1>
    <p>
        There are two kinds of tabs you can include in your app: configurable and static. You may include both static tabs and a configurable tab in your manifest. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Configurable tabs
            </h4>
            <p>
                These tabs require some setup before the user can access the content or service provided. You’re limited to one configurable tab per app. Provide a configuration URL and define your scope (whether the tab can be used by everyone in a channel or if it’s for individual use only). 
            </p>
        </li>
        <div class="pro-tip">
            <p>
                Scope options are non-exclusive. (Meaning, your tab could be built for both personal and team use.)  
            </p>
        </div>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Static tabs
            </h4>
            <p>
                You’re able to include up to 16 static tabs in your app. For each static tab, provide an entity ID, name, content URL, and define the scope.

        Bots

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>
                A bot name
            </h4>
            <p>
                This should match its ID in the bot framework. Your max character length is 64. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                A channel selector
            </h4>
            <p>
                A Boolean value defining whether you want to include a hint asking the user if they want to add the bot to a specific channel.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Notification only or chat
            </h4>
            <p>
                An indication of whether your bot is for one-way communication (i.e., notifications only), or for interactive chat.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>

            <p>
                The list of common commands you want the bot to respond to. Supply a separate command list for each scope, where each command includes a title (max character length 32) and a description (max character length 128).

        Connectors

                        Try to only include a single parameter per command. In our experience, these extensions run more smoothly when they are kept relatively simple.
