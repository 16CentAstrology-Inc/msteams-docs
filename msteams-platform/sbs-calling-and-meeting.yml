    Calling and Meeting Bot provides basic functionality like create a call, join a call, transfer/redirect a call, join a scheduled meeting and invite the participants by integrating cloud communications API Graph API.
    
    Bots can interact with Teams calls and meetings using real-time voice, video, and screen sharing. With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can now interact with users using voice and video to enhance the experience. These APIs allow you to add the following new features:

    * Interactive voice response (IVR).
    * Call control.
    * Access to real-time audio and video streams, including desktop and app sharing.

    To use these Graph APIs in a Teams app, you create a bot and specify some additional information and permissions.
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with calling and meeting functionality. You'll see the following output:

    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
