    Microsoft Teams Connectors is an MVC sample task management application generated using the [ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/outgoing-webhook/csharp) template. The majority of the code is related to either basic MVC configuration or Task management.
    
    The main connector code is found here:
      * ConnectorController.cs - Setup & Save actions
      * TaskController.cs - Create & Update actions

    The following are the functions of Microsoft Teams Connectors:
      * Simulates a real task management system
      * Allows users to create and view tasks

    The content is randomly generated to simulate how notification can be sent into Microsoft Teams channel using connector. For more information on developing apps for Microsoft Teams,see [Microsoft Teams developer documentation](/microsoftteams/platform/overview).
