    Microsoft Teams Connectors is an MVC sample task management application generated using the [ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/outgoing-webhook/csharp) template. The majority of the code is related to either basic MVC configuration or Task management.
    
    The main connector code is found here:
      * ConnectorController.cs - Setup & Save actions
      * TaskController.cs - Create & Update actions

    The following are the functions of Microsoft Teams Connectors:
      * Simulates a real task management system
      * Allows users to create and view tasks

    The content is randomly generated to simulate how notification can be sent into Microsoft Teams channel using connector. For more information on developing apps for Microsoft Teams,see [Microsoft Teams developer documentation](/microsoftteams/platform/overview).

    Perform the following steps to test the connector in Microsoft Teams:
    1. Navigate to **manifest.json** in cloned repository.

       ![Manifest location](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/manifestnavigation.png)

    1. Create a .zip with the following files that are present in the **Manifest** folder: 
       * manifest.json
       * icon-outline.png
       * icon-color.png

       ![Manifest zip](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/zip.png)
   
    1. Go to Microsoft Teams app.
    1. Select **Store** and select **Manage apps**.

       ![Manage Apps](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/manage apps.png)

       ![Upload a custom app](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/upload.png)
      
    1. Select **Open** to upload the .zip file that you created in the **Manifest** folder.

       ![manifest](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/open.png)

    1. Select **Add to a Team**.

    1. Select either **Create** or **Update** on the registration page and select save.

       ![select](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/create.png)

    1. Once the connector is configured, you will get a notification in channel with link to the Task Manager application.

    The sample shows a simple implementation of a connector registration implementation. It also sends a connector card to the registered connector via a process triggered "externally."
    
    Perform the following steps to create your own connector.

    1. Navigate to **TeamsToDoAppConnector.sln** in cloned repository.

       ![sln path](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/sln.png)

    1. Use ngrok or Command prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http -host-header=localhost 3978
     ``` 
       > [!TIP]
       > If you encounter **ERR_NGROK_4018**, follow the steps,as displayed in the command prompt to sign-up and authenticate ngrok. Then run the `ngrok http -host-header=localhost 3978` command.

       ![ngrok path](~/assets/images/sbs-connector/ngrok.png)

    1. Perform the steps to register a new connector in the Connector Developer Portal:

       1. Fill in all the basic details such as name, logo, descriptions etc. for the new connector.
       1. For the configuration page, you'll use our sample code's setup endpoint: https://[BASE_URI]/connector/setup.
       1. For Valid domains, make enter your domain's http or https URL, e.g. XXXXXXXX.ngrok.io.
       1. Enable the action on connector card by selecting the Yes radio button and enter the update endpoint: https://[BASE_URI]/Task/Update.
       1. Click on Save. After the save completes, you will see your connector id.

    1. In the Web.config file, set the configuration.appSettings.Base_Uri variable to the ngrok https forwarding url from the above.
    1. In Visual Studio, click the play button.
    1. Now you can sideload your app package and test your new connector.
