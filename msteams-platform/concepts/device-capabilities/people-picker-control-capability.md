You can use [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true), which provides the people picker API to integrate the people picker control capability within your app. 

## Advantages of integrating people picker control capability

* The `People Picker` API enables you to add a People Picker control to your webapps, which can be surfaced in a task module, as a tab or personal app. 
* This cross platform control allows users to select entities, such as users in a group, chat, channel, or add users through composite entities, such as DLs, SGs and tags. 
* The people picker control capability helps to make the scenarios such as task assignment, tagging or notifying a user, easy. 

To integrate people picker control capability, you must call the people picker API. For effective integration, you must have a good understanding of [code snippets](#code-snippets) for calling the location APIs. 
It is important to familiarize yourself with the [API response errors](#error-handling) to handle the errors in your Teams app.

> [!NOTE] 
> Currently, Microsoft Teams support for people picker control capability is only available for mobile clients.

| **4000** | INVALID_ARGUMENTS | One or more arguments are invalid.|
| **8000** | USER_ABORT |User cancelled the operation.|
| **9000** | OLD_PLATFORM | Platform code is old and doesn't implement this API.|

## Code snippets

```javascript
