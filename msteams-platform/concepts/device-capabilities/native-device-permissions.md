# Request device permissions for your Microsoft Teams app

Microsoft Teams supports the following media capabilities:
  * Camera
  * Microphone
  * Gallery
  * Location

You must request and manage the device permissions to access these media capabilities of a device. The device permissions work similarly for all app constructs, such as tabs or messaging extensions.

Build much richer experiences on Teams platform  by accessing a userâ€™s device permissions, such as:

* Record and share short videos
* Record short audio memos and save them for later use
* Use user location information to display relevant information

While access to these features is standard in most of the modern web browsers, you must inform 
Teams about the features that you are using, by updating your app manifest. This allows you to ask for permissions, while your app is running on the Teams desktop client.
> [!NOTE] 
> Currently, the Microsoft Teams support for media capabilities, is only available for mobile clients.

## Manage permissions

# [Desktop](#tab/desktop)

1. Open Teams.
1. Select your profile icon in the upper right corner of the window.
1. Select **Settings** > **Permissions** from the drop-down menu.
1. Select your desired settings.

## Properties

Update your app's `manifest.json` by adding `devicePermissions` and specifying which of the five properties that you use in your application:

``` json
"devicePermissions": [
    "media",
    "geolocation",
    "notifications",
    "midi",
    "openExternal"
],
```
> [!NOTE]
>
> Media is also used for camera permissions on mobile.

Each property allows you to prompt the user to ask for their consent:

| Property      | Description   |
| --- | --- |
| media         | Permission to use the camera, microphone, speakers, and access media gallery. |
| geolocation   | Permission to return the user's location.      |
| notifications | Permission to send the user notifications.      |
| midi          | Permission to send and receive midi information from a digital musical instrument.   |
| openExternal  | Permission to open links in external applications.  |

## Check permissions from your app

After adding `devicePermissions` to your app manifest, check permissions using the HTML5 permissions API without causing a prompt:

``` Javascript
// Different query options:
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'camera' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'microphone' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'geolocation' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'midi', sysex: true });

// Example:
navigator.permissions.query({name:'geolocation'}).then(function(result) {
  if (result.state == 'granted') {
    // Access granted
  } else if (result.state == 'prompt') {
    // Access has not been granted
  }
});
```

You must leverage the appropriate HTML5 or Teams API, to display a prompt for getting a consent to access device permissions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Support for `camera`, `gallery`, and `microphone` is enabled through [**selectMedia API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/media?view=msteams-client-js-latest#selectMedia_MediaInputs___error__SdkError__attachments__Media_______void_&preserve-view=true). Use [**captureImage API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams?view=msteams-client-js-latest#captureimage--error--sdkerror--files--file-------void-&preserve-view=true) for a single image capture.
> * Support for `location` is enabled through [**getLocation API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/location?view=msteams-client-js-latest#getLocation_LocationProps___error__SdkError__location__Location_____void_&preserve-view=true). You must use this API for location as [**geolocation API**](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#devicepermissions) is currently not fully supported on all desktop clients.

For example:
 * To prompt the user to access their location you must call `getCurrentPosition`:

    ```Javascript
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition    (function (position) { /*... */ });
    ```

 * To use the camera on desktop or web, Teams displays a permission prompt when you call `getUserMedia`:

    ```Javascript
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true });
    ```

 * To capture the image on mobile, Teams mobile asks for permission when you call `captureImage()`:

    ```Javascript
    microsoftTeams.media.captureImage((error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, files: microsoftTeams.media.File[]) => {
      /* ... */
    });
    ```

 * Notifications will prompt the user when you call `requestPermission`:

    ```Javascript
    Notification.requestPermission(function(result) { /* ... */ });
    ```




* To use camera or access photo gallery, Teams mobile asks permission when you call `selectMedia()`:

    ```JavaScript
    microsoftTeams.media.selectMedia({ maxMediaCount: 10, mediaType: microsoftTeams.media.MediaType.Image }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, attachments: microsoftTeams.media.Media[]) => {
      /* ... */
    );
    ```

* To use mic, Teams mobile asks permission when you call `selectMedia()`:

    ```JavaScript 
    microsoftTeams.media.selectMedia({ maxMediaCount: 1, mediaType: microsoftTeams.media.MediaType.Audio }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, attachments: microsoftTeams.media.Media[]) => {
      /* ... */
    });
    ```

* To prompt user to share location on map interface, Teams mobile asks permission when you call `getLocation()`:

    ```JavaScript 
    microsoftTeams.location.getLocation({ allowChooseLocation: true, showMap: true }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, location: microsoftTeams.location.Location) => {
      /* ... *
    /});
    ```

## Permission behavior across login sessions

Device permissions are stored for every login session. This means that if you sign in to another instance of Teams, for example, on another computer, your device permissions from your previous sessions are not available. Therefore, you must re-consent to device permissions for the new session. This also means, if you sign out of Teams or switch tenants in Teams, your device permissions are deleted for the previous login session. 

> [!NOTE]
> When you give consent to the native device permissions, it is valid only for your _current_ login session.
