# Device capabilities 

Teams platform is continuously enhancing developer capabilities aligning with built-in 1P experiences. With the same vision, we have enhanced Teams platform to make it simpler for our partners to integrate device capabilities like camera, photo gallery, mic, and location into their webapps. This greatly lowers the barrier to app development, quickens-up development-cycle, and lights up new scenarios/use-cases for the entire developer community.

It is important to get the prior [permissions](native-device-permissions.md)  Teams supports access to your device's media capabilities, through native device capabilities. The main advantages of accessing device permissions are:
