# Device permissions for the browser

> [!NOTE]
> The latest update on how device permissions are handled in the browser is currently available in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) only.

Teams app that require device permissions, such as camera or microphone access, now require users to manually grant permission at a per app level in the web browser. Previously, the browser handled how to grant access permissions, but now these permissions are handled in Microsoft Teams. This has implications on how you design your application and if they require these permissions in the browser.

## Enable app permissions in the browser
If your Teams app has declared in the [application manifest](native-device-permissions.md#specify-permissions) that it needs device permissions, then the **App permissions** appears for the users to enable the app's device permissions. The **App permissions** option is available in the following capabilities: 

* Personal apps and task module dialogs
* Chats, channel, or meeting tabs

Personal apps and task module dialogs

The **App permissions** option is in the upper-right corner of the page.

Chat, channel, or meeting tabs

The **App permissions** option is in the dropdown of the tab.

After the **App permissions** option is selected a popup displays, where the user can enable the permissions button.

A user will need to enable these permissions in the browser for these permissions to take effect. After user changes the appâ€™s device permissions in the browser, they're prompted to reload the application in Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that the users are aware on how to enable these **App permissions** in Microsoft Teams.

## Recommendation
Teams app that require device permissions in the browser must show instructions to users where to find and enable these permissions in the Teams UI. Depending on the context in which your application is running, you need to ensure your instructions are pointing the user to correct location to access these permissions, as they differ for personal apps, task module dialogs, tabs in chats, and channels or meetings.
