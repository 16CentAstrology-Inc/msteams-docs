# Test and debug your Microsoft Teams bot

testing your bot is a good idea, testing your bot in all enabled contexts is a good idea

## Test by uploading

this is the best idea

## Debug your bot locally

Use ngrok

## Alternative methods

there are other ways to talk to your bot, but they all come with drawbacks

### Use the Bot Emulator

useful to make sure your bot is responding, not useful for formatting or working with any Team specific information

### Talk to you bot directly by GUID

only good for 1:1 testing, don't do this in production
