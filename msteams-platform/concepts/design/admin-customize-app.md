# Allow admins to customize your Microsoft Teams app

Understand how the Teams admin can customize or rebrand the app based on an org's need. This customization is enabled if you define the `configurableProperties` in the manifest schema. For more information, see [Customize apps in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/customize-apps).

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in developer preview only.
> 
> App customization enables admins to change the look-and-feel of the apps loaded through bots, messaging extensions, tabs, and connectors. For example, if the Teams admin customizes the name of an app from *Contoso* to *Contoso Agent*, then the app will appear with the new name *Contoso Agent* to users. However, while adding a connector to a chat, in the list the connectors will still show the name of the app as *Contoso*.
> 
> As a best practice, you must provide customization guidelines for app users and customers to follow when customizing your app. For more information, see [customize apps in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/customize-apps).
