# Enable orgs to customize your Microsoft Teams app

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in developer preview only.

You can allow orgs (specifically Teams admins) to customize some aspects of your Microsoft Teams app. Some possible examples include:

* Changing the app's accent color to match the org's brand.
* Updating the app name from *Contoso* to *Contoso Agent*, which is the name users in the org will see. (Note: Users adding a connector to a chat will still see the original app name, *Contoso*).

You can enable this with `configurableProperties` in the app manifest. For more information, see [customize apps in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/customize-apps).

## Best practices

Provide guidelines for customers who want to customize your app. For more information, see [customize apps in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/customize-apps).
