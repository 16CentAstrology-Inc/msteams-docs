# How to plan apps for Teams mobile

## Think Mobile-specific Strategy

Desktop and mobile are not just 2 different form factors but rather users prefer one over the other for various use-cases. For instance, your users would prepare or groom data on desktop, but they might consume this data more on mobile and share it with others while on the move. Another important aspect to consider here is the cross-device functionality of your Teams app. There are users of Teams who would consume your app on both - desktop and mobile. Some of the other users might just be mobile-only.
It might be complex to migrate your entire desktop experience on mobile in one pass. Hence, it would be more effective to start with basic and high frequency scenarios. More functionalities can be added in subsequent updates of your app after you have gathered insights and user feedback.
Another important consideration is to think about the user persona that you want to target on mobile app. It is tempting to cater to all the personas that you have on your desktop app, however, it is recommended to start with the persona that will have a larger base and would be early adopters for your smaller screen experience.
Examples given in the subsequent sections are going to elucidate the steps that you can take to strategize your app on Teams mobile apps.
The paradigm in these examples follow the framework given below:
* Consumption: Let the users view your app experience on mobile
* Quick Actions: Allow users to take actions on the experience that they are viewing on your mobile app
* Enablement: Now enable your users to create new experiences and engage deeply with your mobile app

## Think Mobile Framework

### Consumption: Start Small

While planning to build a mobile app, you can start with the consumption experience first. The consumption experience will give good triggers to your users to start using your mobile app. Since the mobile world has made users habitual to scrolling for content, you might want to start with just showing the relevant information. Use engagement mechanisms such as notifications to tell users about the new updates in the content.

### Quick Actions: Companion to Desktop App
Once your users have started consuming the content on mobile, you can think about scaling your app to the next level. You can now migrate some of the actions from your desktop app or build newer actions optimized for mobile.

### Enablement: Self-sufficient Experience on Mobile
If your users have started engaging with your app by consuming and taking actions, it would be the apt time to get the full immersive experience on mobile app. This can be either at par or above par with your desktop experience. Invest in making all the scenarios responsive on mobile so that it is a rewarding experience for your users.

## Scenarios

### Dashboarding & Data Visualization Apps
You can plan dashboarding and data visualization domain apps on Teams mobile platform.

Phase 1: Consumption
In the first phase of the plan, the app developer can think about implementing the most basic consumption experience on the mobile app – viewing data. The primary purpose of any app in this domain is to show data in the form of visualizations. Hence, you can start with showing the most recently viewed visualizations by the users on desktop or show them the list of all the charts that are authorized for the users.

You can show the information such as these on the Teams mobile apps: 

•	Dashboards and Summaries
•	Data visuals like Maps and Infographics
•	Charts, Graphs, Tables etc. 

Users can consume this information on mobile, once they have created these dashboards from your desktop app. You can show a detailed view of any chart clicked by the user in the form of an expanded view inside your tabs or by leveraging task modules.

Phase 2: Quick Actions
In the next part of your app development, you can introduce actions such as these inside your dashboarding and visualization app on mobile platform:

•	Searching for content
•	Filtering data
•	Bookmarking

Let the users slice and dice the existing charts and visuals created from the desktop app using the actions introduced in this phase.

Phase 3: Enablement
Now, enable the users to create content in this stage. They should be able to create charts and graphics from scratch. You can also use task modules to deep dive into specific data items that require more detailed view.

Your users should be able to modify the title, axes description and insert data items to create visualizations that can be consumed and shared with the broader group in a channel or group chat. All these capabilities should be possible from your mobile app in Teams now.
