# Plan to monetize your app

One of the most important objectives for building an app is to solve the problems of your users in a collaborative zone. An app that achieves this goal is fit for being a utility for global consumption.
Microsoft Teams app store provide features that enable you to monetize your apps and gain customers by engaging with your users.

Consider publishing your app on Teams store to offer your app the best platform for global visibility. Factors, such as type of app, nature of service, target customers influence the best monetization option for your app.

The most common ways to monetize your apps are:

- Subscription: You can choose to offer your app as a service to your users for a regular subscription. Include a Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offer with your app to enable subscription plans for your users. Teams store lets your users purchase subscription plans.
- In-app purchases: You can offer a free download of your app with limited basic features. For more or advanced features, offer your users to upgrade to a full version or additional services.

In addition to these features, Teams store also offers:

- Free trials: You can offer your app to users for a time-limited usage. It lets your users try the app features for a set number of days or times.
- Test preview: Teams store lets you preview and test a SaaS offer before you publish your app.

Establishing a monetizing option beforehand helps guide the app design, app build and platform options, and app distribution decisions.
