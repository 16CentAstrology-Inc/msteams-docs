# Growth lifecycle for your app

Growing your app is a journey, a process that’s not overnight and goes through various stages. Here’s how a typical growth lifecycle of a collaborative app on Teams looks like depicting critical barriers that once crossed puts the app into the next orbit for even higher growth:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/app-fundamentals/growth-lifecycle.png" alt-text="App growth lifecycle":::

- **Build stage** – This is the stage when developers plan, envision, design, build and publish their collaborative app on the Microsoft Teams marketplace. While the Teams developer platform documentation is the one-stop shop for platform features, best practices and developer guidance, select strategic developers can join an invite-only Teams engineering’s build-with partner program on this journey.
- **Launch stage** – Once the collaborative app is published on the Teams marketplace, this is the stage where launch marketing initiatives are executed for the app to announce the availability of the app for existing and new/prospective customers.
- **Traction stage** – This stage has dual purpose & focus – (a) building awareness for the app through impactful customer & seller marketing channels and (b) build product, sales, customer success & support functions’ readiness for the app’s upcoming adoption, growth and ROI realization. Most growth and GTM activities during this stage are pilots to discover effectiveness, learning and execution rhythms. When the app crosses the “traction barrier” (depicted above), one can say it has achieved product market fit in Teams marketplace and ecosystem.
- **Scale stage** – This stage encompasses scaling in the market on the back of activation in existing customers who use the SaaS app outside Teams and selling to new customers through product-, sales- and channel- led initiatives. Growth and GTM activities become more programmatic at this stage. When the app crosses the scale barrier, often also referred to as the “growth barrier” (depicted above), one can conclude the apps is ready to deliver on the business goals and starts to deliver ROI on engineering & GTM investments.
- **Succeed stage** - The final stage of the Teams collaborative app lifecycle is where the app moves from being a product integration built on Teams into a full-fledged strategic product line just as the core SaaS product for the web browser or native apps for Windows or mobile phones. The activities at this stage include building public references for the impact of the collaborative app among customers, optimizing customer sales and conversion based on PQLs and investing further in more user-valuable scenarios/experiences inside the app.

While there will always be examples of developers short circuiting the lifecycle to jump across stages for eg: directly starting to monetize their app after launch using their version 1 experience itself, we recommend a stage-by-stage approach as a best practice that most developers follow to derive the best ROI from their Teams app journey.

## Product and GTM growth initiatives for your app

Below is a descriptive guide elaborating on the various growth initiatives developers can plan and execute as well as where Microsoft can help. While developers are strongly encouraged to follow the guidance here to grow their app and drive success for their investments on the Teams marketplace and ecosystem, please note that the guidance provided cannot be considered totally comprehensive. Developers should always adapt these growth initiatives to their business, the app they’ve launched on Teams and their target customer personas basis the context best known to them.

Do note that Microsoft partners with app developers once they’ve launched their apps on Teams marketplace by offering select, programmatic GTM investments depending on the app’s maturity in the market. Developers must get in touch with their Microsoft field, account or engineering representatives before spending cycles on their app growth planning and execution, so that they can get the most appropriate guidance they’re eligible for. Additionally, when the app you are developing reaches store validation stage or if it is already published, please sign up for the M365 ISV Benefits Program and review the Marketing Benefits Planning Guide for an overview of the marketing activities your app is eligible to participate in. The Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk is available for any email correspondence regd. support for your marketing activity.

## Launching your collaborative app

By now you are aware that the core focus at this stage is to announce the availability of the app for existing and new customers. Here’s a rundown of various initiatives and growth levers at your disposal:

### What should you as a developer do during the Launch stage?

- **Invest strategically into your app store listing, landing page & documentation**

    Make sure you’ve links to your Teams app handy for use in your landing page, documentation, marketing materials etc. Refer here: Promote your app on another site to fetch the link to your app inside the Teams in-product marketplace. For AppSource link, head over to Microsoft AppSource and search for your app in the search box. Pick the URL from the browser’s address bar.

- **New social media posts announcing the Teams collaborative app**

    You can generate interest from both existing and new customers as well as drive traffic to your app‘s landing page or directly to the app’s listing in Teams Marketplace through social media posts and paid campaigns executed on your social channels. Don’t forget to include media such as a video or an animated gif in your post to make it rich and interactive. Tag @M365 and @MicrosoftTeamsi in your posts as well as use the hashtags #Teamsapps, #MicrosoftTeams, #TeamsISV throughout the year in social media posts for your collaborative app to extend exposure and flag Microsoft’s social team for a potential retweet. Connect with the Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk to seek guidance for your social media campaign, possible collaboration with Microsoft for execution and the success metrics you should measure for eg: # of views/clicks on your social posts, # of visitors on your landing page, no. of MQLs generated on the landing page, # of visitors to the app’s listing in marketplace, # of Teams app installs post launch etc.

- **Public blog post announcing the new Teams app**

    Blog posts help communicate the value of your app and its integration with Microsoft Teams to your audience. Use your blog to introduce your Teams app, how to use it and communicate the value prop for your users including use cases, scenarios, customer stories. Include logos, animated gifs, screenshots, quotes, URLs and information pertinent to promoting your app. Note: When using your blog channel to drive press/media coverage or to request Microsoft quotes, please refer to Microsoft’s Press Release guidelines for reviews (see the press release section). Example blog posts: Wrike, Adobe Creative Cloud, MeisterTask, MindMeister, Workday

- **Press Release announcing the new Teams app**

    Use PRs to publicly announce the application you have built and your collaboration with Microsoft. Note that press releases and quotes must be reviewed by Microsoft representatives. Connect with the Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk to avail of the service to review your press release draft and get a quote from Microsoft. Once you publicly post your press release, evangelize through other channels. Microsoft does not post partner press releases. Example press releases

- **Banners in web SaaS app to announce the new Teams app**

    Include in-product CTAs prominently in your web SaaS product to let users know about your new/updated Teams collaborative app. You can leverage transient banners, notifications bar, what’s new notifications inside the SaaS product’s UI for all users or push notifications to relevant users such as those belonging to your customer organizations who use Microsoft 365. The banner/notification CTA can direct users to your app‘s landing page or directly to the app’s listing in Teams Marketplace.

- **Free & extended trials for new Teams users**

    Since your goal at this stage is to achieve product-market fit for your app, it’s critical to learn how users are perceiving your new app and if they’re getting the intended value by using the app. If not already done for your core SaaS product, offer free trials to users who sign up for your app (and SaaS service) through the Teams channel. If you already offer trials for your SaaS product and your standard free trial period is 15 days, consider extending the trial period for Teams users to 30-60 days. Given you’ve built your Teams app for collaborative use cases, you will naturally want trial users to invite their colleagues as well to use your app in shared context inside Teams. An extended trial facilitates collaborative evaluation of your app and increases the likelihood of these users converting to paid and sticky customers.

- **Launch offers & promotions to acquire users for Teams app**

    To acquire new customers for your Teams collaborative app, consider offering a little extra incentive to Teams users over and above what’s available for your core SaaS product. If your app requires paid subscriptions, consider offering launch period discounts. Even promotions such as 1:1 product demos, customer success consultations, invite-only webinars, trainings for the entire business unit/team using your Teams app can go a long way to differentiate your app and accelerate customer acquisition. If you have already listed your transactable SaaS subscriptions for the Teams app in the marketplace, make sure to price them at a discount to encourage users to purchase your offer directly from the Teams marketplace.

- **Announce Teams app to your entire customer base**

    The first time your Teams app goes live on the marketplace as well as for major subsequent updates, consider outreach to your entire customer base announcing the availability of the app. While social media posts, public blog post and press releases are for the entire world audience, to-customer emails are the best channel to drive awareness about your app within existing customer organizations. Make sure to introduce your Teams app, how to use it and communicate the value prop for your users very briefly including use cases, scenarios, customer stories via animated gifs, screenshots, quotes and CTAs to your app’s public landing page and install links to the Teams marketplace for those willing to get started immediately.

- **App Bill of Materials: Pitch deck, value prop, demo, datasheets etc.**
