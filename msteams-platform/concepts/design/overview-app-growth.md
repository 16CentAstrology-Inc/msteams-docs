# Plan, strategize and execute growth for your app

Shipping your app on the Teams marketplace is just the beginning. Once shipped, you must meticulously plan how to grow your app, make it a successful product on the marketplace that drives intended business metrics and helps you realize returns on your investment into planning, designing, and building the app.

This document provides high-level guidance about how you should strategize and execute growth for your app, what decisions you need to make, what levers you can pull, what programs, resources, and guidance you can leverage and some proven best practices from those who’ve crafted the Teams platform and the commercial marketplace itself to make your app successful.

## Putting your app’s growth potential into perspective: How much can your app grow?

You’ll probably not be surprised to hear that not all apps are equal on any marketplace. Teams apps can greatly differ from each other in terms of use cases fulfilled, personas served, end-user user experience and user value delivered. As a developer, you can:

1. **Just test waters**: Take a “foot-in-the door” approach where your SaaS backend is leveraged to provide an elevated, ephemeral end-user experience using link unfurling feature to show rich URL previews as cards from your domain are shared inside Teams, even when the user doesn't have your app installed.
1. **Build a complementary, companion experience to your core web SaaS**: Build your Teams app serving as a point solution usually called “add-in”, “plug-in” or an “integration” for select, frequent, isolated, and lightweight use cases which the user can get done inside Teams; or
1. **Build a “collaborative app” product line**: Provide Teams users a unique, differentiated, rich, familiar, end to end and deeply immersive experience – all contained in Teams and centered around collaboration versus individual productivity. [Collaborative apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/11/02/stay-in-the-flow-of-work-with-new-collaborative-apps-for-microsoft-teams/), a new app pattern designed to bring people, processes, and data together to help users thrive in the hybrid workplace are positioned to completely transform how people in every organization do more together with the help of ubiquitous software in the flow of work.

Needless to say, from the options above, the strategy you'll take will determine the resulting user value, the economic opportunity for you and how you can maximize the ROI from your investments. This document will assume you’ve taken a strategic view of your Teams investment by developing a “collaborative app” – one where the user is able to get designated “jobs” seamlessly done in the flow of their work with full context, without ever leaving Microsoft Teams. Since collaborative apps are best positioned to win new customer deals for you and upsell or cross-sell to your existing customers, that investment has the potential to deliver the highest net new economic opportunity for your business. Using the guidance in this document, you can grow your collaborative app on Teams, expand differentiated scenarios further, incorporate Teams-first/only use cases & devise a Teams app-led go-to-market model to build a growth flywheel for your business.

## Options for growing your app: Understanding growth models

Without going too deep, summarizing the three predominant types of SaaS business growth models:

1. **Sales-led growth** – where potential customers or “sales-qualified leads (SQLs)” interact with a sales rep or a customer success rep right off the bat at every stage of the buying journey from understanding product your SaaS app’s features, seeing a demo, post-purchase setup and config, sales-led user onboarding & customer success reps training to use the app.
1. **Marketing-led growth** – where prospective customers sign up for a product demo after building perceived value of your product by consuming marketing narratives such as ads, content resources such as blogs, videos, or downloadable e-books and as a result generating a “marketing-qualified lead (MQL)” for the sales team to convert. Customer retention and monetization are driven by marketing channels, content, and outreach as well.
1. **Product-led growth** – where your SaaS product itself is the main driving force behind customer acquisition, activation, retention, revenue growth, virality, and expansion by offering self-serve freemium or free trial options and a straightforward frictionless onboarding process to users so that they can start using the product right away and experience direct product value first-hand with minimal sales, marketing, or customer success interactions on the way. “Product-qualified leads (PQLs)” who have experienced meaningful value using the product are the ones more likely to become paying customers either directly or through salesforce’s upsell or intervention.

As a developer who’s built a collaborative app, you'll benefit from devising a well-rounded strategy that employs all three - sales, marketing, and product-led tactics to help you grow your product that is, the Teams app among hundreds of millions of Teams users.

More than point solutions that is, “add-ins” and “integrations” Teams collaborative apps offer you an opportunity to apply a solid growth strategy to a product line, just as you would do for your core SaaS product for the web browser or native mobile apps.
