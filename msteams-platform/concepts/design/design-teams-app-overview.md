## Creating a cohesive experience

Designing a Teams app is like designing a conventional web app—but also a little different. An effective design highlights the app's unique attributes and fits naturally with Teams features and contexts.

These guidelines and resources can help you strike that balance. You'll understand what to do and what to avoid when designing your Teams app (such as multi-level navigation in a tab).

## Planning your app

You can't design a high-quality Teams app without first knowing what you want the app to do and how you think people will use it. If you haven't already, you should properly [plan your app](../../concepts/extensibility-points.md).

## Design fundamentals

Learn the [fundamentals of Teams app design](design-teams-app-fundamentals.md), including layout, color schemes, and more.

## Basic UI components

Based on the Fluent Design System, these are the [core elements for creating familiar Teams interfaces](design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md).

## App capabilities

Understand how people add and use Teams apps to make the most of each capability in your design.
