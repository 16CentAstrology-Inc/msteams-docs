# Design your Microsoft Teams app

Designing a Teams app is like designing a conventional web app—but also a little different.

Whether you're a designer, product manager, developer, or maker using low-code tools, these guidelines can help you quickly make the right design decisions for your app.

## Plan your app

You can't design a high-quality Teams app without first understanding what you want the app to do and how you think people will use it. If you haven't already, you should properly [plan your app](../../concepts/extensibility-points.md).

## Teams app design principles

Teams apps help people achieve more together. Use these principles to guide your design.

### Promotes collaboration

Teams apps help people achieve more together. Use these principles to guide your design.

### Trustworthy

The app is secure and compliant. Users can easily find information about privacy.

### Globally inclusive

People of all backgrounds, skillsets, and disciplines can use the app. It’s culturally, racially, and socially aware.

### Light

The app focuses on core scenarios that blend with Teams workflows.

### Native or distinct

The app uses native Teams design components or your own. There’s no blend of color schemes, controls, etc.

### Useful

The app is based on a scenario people need to do in Teams.

### Easy to use

The UI is easy to understand, pleasant in look and tone, and makes people more productive.

### Responsive

The app is device and screen agnostic.

### Accessible

The app meets Teams accessibility requirements in terms of color contrast, navigation alternatives, and more.

### Well described

Text, icons, and images make it clear what the app is for and how to use it.

## UI templates

Quickly create complex, high-fidelity designs with templates for common Teams use cases and workflows.

## Get started with the Microsoft Teams UI Design Kit

The Microsoft Teams UI Design Kit helps you create high-fidelity mockups of your app without writing any code.
<!-- Need link in Step 1. -->
1. Duplicate the design kit from the Figma Community.
1. Drag and drop components from the design kit to your file.
1. Modify the components as needed for your app.

## Creating a cohesive look and feel

Apps extend Teams features and functionality using one or more platform [capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md). Your app presents these capabilities (whether it's a tab, messaging extension, bot, or webhook) with UI components and patterns that make sense within Teams.

While you have flexibility, designing your app effectively requires knowing what UI works for certain capabilities (and what doesn't). For example, while multi-level navigation is fine for websites, it isn't ideal for a Teams tab because the app probably isn't focusing on just core activities and scenarios.

Your design also must thread components together in a way that feels natural not only to your use cases but with regular Teams workflows. (This is especially true if your app has more than one capability, like a bot replying with a link to a tab with a form to fill out.)

## UI templates

In most cases, each capability in your Teams app needs a UI. Teams design components, based on the [Fluent UI Design System](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/), make your app feel familiar within the platform.

See the [Power Platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/) for low-code app design guidelines.
