# Distribute your app

## Distribute

Once you have finished defining your application, the *Distribute* section allows you export your appâ€™s definition as a zip file which then can be shared and uploaded into the Teams client for testing. Clicking export downloads the zip file as *appname.zip* in your default download directory.

## Publish your app to Teams

On your project home page, you can upload your app to a team, submit your app to your company custom app store for users in your organization, or submit your app to App Source for all Teams users. Your IT admin will review these submissions. You can return to the *Publish* page to check on your submission status and learn if your app was approved or rejected by your IT admin. This is also where you'll come to submit updates to your app or cancel any currently active submissions.
