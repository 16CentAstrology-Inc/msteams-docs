# Succeeding with your collaborative app

To wrap up, your collaborative app is now becoming a full-fledged strategic product line similar to your core SaaS product for the web browser or native apps for Windows or mobile phones. To maximize success for your customers and ROI for your business, here are the initiatives and growth levers you must leverage:

## What should you as a developer do during this final stage?

- **Wider TAM coverage across existing and prospect user base**:

    Continue to increase the usage of your collaborative app on Teams through existing customer activation and new customer acquisition via the Teams marketplace or through sales-led customer deal wins leading with your app.

- **Report and celebrate customer activation, deal wins and revenue**:

    Share notable customer wins, customer success stories and resulting revenue from user acquisition or deal wins attributed to your Teams app with your Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives so that Microsoft can selectively drive executive visibility for your app and explore any possible GTM or marketing-drive acceleration for your app.

- **Convert PQLs from Teams app into active sales pipeline**:

    A core product-led growth initiative, capture Teams marketplace trials, trials sign-ups coming from your Teams app or freemium users as potential leads to be converted into paying customers. Remember to monitor the usage patterns, user retention and product value experienced by the trial or freemium users to determine which customers ca be converted through sales, customer success or direct product interventions (for example, upsell, upgrade prompts).

    Retaining users by providing them a sticky experience is key to growing your Teams app and realizing economic value from your product and GTM investments. Make sure you’ve implemented robust and granular analytics for your Teams app that serves your need to measure when and which users have churned or likely to churn from your app. You can them re-engage and re-target them via outreach channels within or outside your product.

- **Invest in richer and more impactful user scenarios**:

    Innovation, grounded in customer needs, is the key to sustainably grow and succeed with your app on Teams.
