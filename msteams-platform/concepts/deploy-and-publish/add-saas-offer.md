# Create a SaaS offer for your Teams app

Adding a Software as a Service (SaaS) offer to your app solution is an app monetization approach that enables users to easily connect to and use your cloud-based app and allows you to enhance the user experience by delivering automated upgrades/updates and increased access across platforms. Microsoft Teams apps are free to install in the Teams environment, but some may require users to purchase a SaaS subscription to experience the app's full functionality and/or scope. SaaS subscriptions can be purchased from a cloud service provider or you can create a SaaS subscription for your Teams app directly through Partner Center or the Commercial Marketplace via the [Azure SaaS fulfillment APIs](/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-apis).
