# Add a default install scope and group capability

Itâ€™s common for an app to support multiple scenarios in Teams, but you may have designed it with a specific scope and capability in mind. For example, if your app is primarily for team or channel use, you can make sure that the first install option users see in the store is **Add to a team**.

If your app's primary capability is a bot, you can also make the bot the default capability when a user installs your app to a team. 

## Configure your app's default install scope

Configure the default install scope for your app. You can set only one scope at a time.

**To configure details in app manifest**

1. Open your manifest schema, and add the `defaultInstallScope` property to it.
2. Set a value of `personal`, `team`, `groupchat`, or `meetings` (see an example below).

    Following is a JSON example:

    ```json
    "defaultInstallScope": "meetings",
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see the [app manifest schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

## Configure the default capability for shared scopes

Configure the default capability when your app is installed for a team, meeting, or chat.

**To configure details in app manifest**

1. Open your app manifest and add the `defaultGroupCapability` property to it.
2. Save the updates.

    Following is a JSON example:

    ```json
    "defaultGroupCapability": {
        "team": "bot",
        "groupchat": "bot",
        "meetings": "tab"
    }
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> For information on full schema, see [manifest schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).
