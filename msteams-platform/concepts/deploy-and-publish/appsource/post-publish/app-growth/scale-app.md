# Scale your collaborative app

In the Scaling stage in the app growth lifecycle, you put the learnings from previous ad-hoc, pilot motions to use. You use them to programmatically activate existing customers and sell to new customers via all possible initiatives.

The following growth levers are pertinent at this stage:

## What should you as a developer do during the Scale stage?

- **Become CSP channel ready for the Teams app**:

    Listing your SaaS subscriptions on the Teams marketplace gives you access to 90,000+ reseller partners (called [cloud solution providers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X33C-RV9dZc) or CSPs) around the world. These CSPs manage a significant customer install base. You can scale your business through this channel without making a full investment in solutions, experts, salesforce, and events. However, you can instead get to market faster, and at exponential scale, compared to selling solely through your own sales motions.

To scale your app, become CSP channel ready. After that, your app will get featured on this [landing page](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=monetize-your-app) to appear in [Teams apps that have become CSP Channel Ready](https://aka.ms/P2PeBook) public handbook.

For more information, see [CSP Channel Readiness Guide](https://aka.ms/TeamsMonetization/CSPChannelReadyGuide) for Teams app ISVs.

- **Onboard CSP resellers to extend app’s sales reach**:

    After you become CSP channel ready by completing the pre-requisites, browse through the CSP list on the Partner Center to find resellers to negotiate a partnership. You can find detailed partner profile information in the Partner Center or using the public [partner finder](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-dir) on AppSource.

- **Tailor SaaS offers for customers and CSP resellers**:

    Teams marketplace allows you to create private offers, that is, time-bound pricing of your SaaS subscription for Teams app with customized, pre-negotiated terms for [CSPs](/azure/marketplace/isv-csp-reseller). You can also create [private plans](/azure/marketplace/private-plans) for targeted customers to offer negotiated pricing. Help your sales team secure large new customer deals leading with your Teams collaborative app. Offer private pricing to your customers via the Teams marketplace. You can leave tax remittance, payments, and subscription billing to Microsoft.

- **Digital webinars for existing customers and new prospects**:

    Host digital webinars at regular cadences to showcase the value of your Teams app to customers. Your customer success team and pre-sales or sales team must funnel relevant existing customers and new prospects as leads to target these webinar invitations to. Ensure that you include links to sign up for the webinars on your app’s landing page on your website and your app store listing. It attracts new, exploratory users who may be interested in learning more about the app. Get in touch with your field, account, or engineering representatives from Microsoft to request their participation in hero instances of these to-customer webinars.

- **Digital ad campaigns to target customers for app install and use**:

    Generate interest from new customer accounts. Drive traffic to your collaborative app listing in Teams marketplace using paid media campaigns executed on your social channels. Connect with the [Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk](mailto:ModernWorkISVPartner@microsoft.com) to seek guidance for your digital campaign, identify target customer accounts and personas, collaboration on paid media plan, possible budget funding and agreeing on the success metrics you should measure for example, click-through rate, cost per click, number of clicks, number of MQLs generated on the landing page, number of visitors to the app’s listing in marketplace, resulting number of Teams app installs, and so on.

- **Publish customer demand and app’s impact story**:

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            Share real customer stories using a 4–5-minute video. Showcase increased employee productivity caused by using your collaborative app inside Teams. Use this video for demand generation, digital marketing campaigns or showcased on public pages. Nominate a customer and gain their commitment to participate in the story. Work with the customer on the narrative. Ensure that you include the benefits derived from your collaborative app. You can also talk about the added productivity gains seen by the customer (quantifiable gains are preferred).

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

    After developing it, host these customer stories on the landing page of the Teams app on your website. Promote it via paid, earned media, or social media posts to highlight the success of the app.

- **Showcase Teams app in leading industry events**:

    While building traction, you showcased the collaborative app in Teams during your annual customer conference. It’s time to expand the coverage to well-known public industry events where you've a prominent presence or conferences which you sponsor. Your executives can include the Teams app in their keynote or showcase your innovation centre-stage. It's bound to attract both existing and new prospective customers.

- **User re-targeting and re-engagement basis app analytics**:

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            Product-led growth initiative uses signals from your app analytics. It retargets users who have recently engaged with your app in Teams but haven't reached a value realization milestone defined by you. Users who’s not visited your app or churned recently can be re-engaged to bring back to your app.

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

    Remember, your goal is to get users to experience value by using your collaborative app. They can convert to sticky, habitual users and eventually convert into paying customers.

- **Co-activation in mutually identified existing customers**:

    Based on the list you’ve shared with the Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives while building traction, it’s time to execute co-activation and adoption of your collaborative app in customer accounts with significant seat sizes. Your customer success team will play a major driving role in this motion. They can work alongside business decision makers, IT decision makers, and end-users that is, employees of the customer organization who are going to use your app inside Teams. Just enabling the app inside Teams won't be enough. Instead, adoption and change management practices led by your customer success team through organization-wide emailers at regular cadences, flyers, retention campaigns, user trainings, identifying and scaling through app champions in each team and constantly keeping an eye on app usage metrics within the customer’s tenant is required to form a habit among users.

- **Growth hacking via in-product scenario experimentation**:

    Continuously monitor what’s happening inside your collaborative app through analytics and measure the value end-users are obtaining. To positively impact product and business metrics such as, number of app installs, activation rate, task completing, new user retention and churn, referrals, and so on, a rapid, always-on experimentation work-stream allows byte-sized tweaks to your app experience. It results in more control and lesser risk compared to large changes spaced far apart. Ensure that you instrument code and track analytics for your app from the first version. Upskill your dedicated Teams app crew or your existing SaaS product growth team of PM, development, and design on Teams platform to take ownership of this work-stream to derive maximum ROI.

## Where can Microsoft help?
