# Submit your app to AppSource

Publish your app on AppSource to make it available to your end users in the Teams app catalog and on the web. At a high level, the process for submitting your app to AppSource is:

1. Develop your app following our [design guidelines](~/concepts/design/understand-use-cases.md). Tabs should follow our [tab design guidelines](~/tabs/design/tabs.md) and your bot should follow the [bot design guidelines](~/bots/design/bots.md).
2. [Register as a developer](#register-as-a-developer) with Microsoft.
3. Prepare your app for submission: Make sure your app passes the [Submission checklist](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/overview.md)
4. Go through our [Tips and most frequently failed cases](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/frequently-failed-cases.md) for a quicker approval process.
5. Submit your package to App Source through [Partner Center](/office/dev/store/use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource) and monitor your Partner Center dashboard to track approval.
6. Post submission: Check our guidance for [Maintaining and supporting your published app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

Please follow the instructions provided [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/open-a-developer-account) to open a developer account in Partner Center.
We do have dedicated support team for the Office Store program, you can open a [support ticket](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportforbusiness/productselection?sapId=48734891-ee9a-5d77-bf29-82bf8d8111ff) if you have issues with registration, itâ€™ll get routed appropriately. 

By developing and submitting a Microsoft Teams app that contains a bot, you are subject to the Bot Developer Framework [Terms of Use](https://aka.ms/bf-terms), [Privacy Policy](https://aka.ms/bf-privacy), and [Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/bf-conduct). If your app contains Office 365 Connector functionality, separate terms may also apply as part of your Connector Registration on the [Connectors Developer Dashboard](https://aka.ms/connectorsdashboard).
