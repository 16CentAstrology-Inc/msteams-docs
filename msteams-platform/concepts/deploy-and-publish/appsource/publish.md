To list your app on the Microsoft Teams store (and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com)), use the following steps to guide you through the process.

1. [Review store validation guidelines](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/frequently-failed-cases.md). To pass submission, make sure your app adheres to these guidelines.
1. [Prepare your store submission](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist.md). Validate your app one last time, create store listing details, and complete other important tasks before submitting your app for review.
1. [Submit your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/add-in-submission-guide) through Partner Center.
1. [Maintain your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md). Learn what you need to do to support your app going forward and drive growth.
