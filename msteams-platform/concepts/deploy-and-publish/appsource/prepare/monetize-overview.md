**Charge a price for your app**

You can charge a price for your app up front. We support a comprehensive range of price tiers, including the option to set per-market prices. You can even schedule a sale to reduce the price of your app for a limited period of time.

**Free trials**

You can offer a free trial version of your app to get more customers to try it. To entice customers to buy the full version, you can limit the features in the trial version (for example, only including the first level of a game), show ads, or specify a time-limited trial.

**In-app purchases**

Whether you charge a price for your app or offer it for free, you can use in-app purchases in your app to provide an ongoing revenue stream. Use in-app purchases to let customers upgrade from a free to a paid version of your app, or offer durable or consumable add-ons for sale within your app.
