# Microsoft Teams store (AppSource) submission guidelines

Following these guidelines increases the chances your app will pass Microsoft Teams store (and AppSource) submission. The information here, which complements the Microsoft [commercial marketplace certification policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies), is specific to Teams apps and will be updated frequently to reflect new Teams capabilities, user feedback, and changes to business rules.

Submit feedback on these guidelines [here](NEED LINK).

If your app doesn't pass review according to these guidelines and the commercial marketplace certification policies, the Microsoft validation team will contact you with a report on why your submission failed. The team works 24 hours a day, five days a week and can provide white-glove service to help your app meet our criteria.

## Using these guidelines

Some of these guidelines may not be applicable to you. For example, if your app doesn't have a bot, you can ignore those guidelines.

## 1.0 Value proposition

### 1.1 App title

An app's name plays a critical role in how users discover it in the AppSource app store. Your app's short name is displayed on the details page. App title must have relevant terms, must not copy an existing app in the store, must not use "Teams" or Microsoft product names to falsely indicate co-branding or co-selling, and meet all the guidelines for app names. When referring to Microsoft trademarks and the names of Microsoft software, products, and services, follow [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general).

### 1.2 Suitable for workplace consumption

Your app may work for team to drive collaboration and/or for individual users to improve their productivity.

Apps catering to team bonding and socializing needs of Microsoft Teams users may be published. Such apps should not require intense time investment or perceptively impact productivity. These apps must be collaborative and designed for multiple participants. All content should be suitable for general workplace consumption.

Apps must abide by all restrictions in [100.10 Inappropriate Content](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content) of the commercial marketplace certification policies. Content related to religion, politics, gambling, and prolonged entertainment is prohibited.

### 1.3 Other platforms and services

Teams apps must focus on the Teams experience and must not include names, icons, or imagery of other similar chat-based collaborative platforms or services unless the apps provide specific interoperability.

## 2.0 Security

### 2.1 Publisher attestation

Microsoft 365 App compliance program that is intended to help organizations assess and manage risk in using apps by collecting security, data handling, and compliance information. App gets Badge in AppSource & provides added confidence in the security and compliance measures of your application.

Teams apps must complete Publisher Attestation in Partner Center. See the Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program documentation to learn how to complete the Publisher Attestation workflow.
