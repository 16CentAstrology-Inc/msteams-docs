# Purchasable web apps

Application software that runs on a web server is called a web app. Users can access these web apps through a web browser and an active internet connection. You can publish your web apps on AppSource and Microsoft Teams app store. After the app is authenticated and published on AppSource, end-users can purchase the app subscription directly from the Teams app store.

## Software as a Service (SaaS) on Teams app store

Teams apps are free to install, however, some apps require purchasing service subscriptions to experience the application's full functionality and scope. These service subscriptions are called SaaS offers, which are available for purchase through AppSource and now through the Microsoft Teams app store.
After your offer has been submitted to Partner Center along with the appropriate plans for the offer, a review is conducted. After it passes the validation, it is available for you to test and publish it to our commercial marketplace. In the commercial marketplace, your offer is automatically available for purchase from the Teams app store along with AppSource and Azure Marketplace. To publish your purchasable web apps, follow the pre-submission checklist in the next section.

## Submit app to AppSource

AppSource helps business users to find and try SaaS apps from Microsoft and its partners. Microsoft AppSource apps include web apps and apps built on Microsoft dynamics. Your app must be listed on AppSource and the Teams app store. You must complete the approval process provided by Microsoft Teams that verifies your app works as described and contains the relevant metadata and content that is valuable to the other.
Follow the submission checklist for submitting an app to AppSource:
* [Pre-submission checklist](submission-checklist.md)
* [App manifest checklist](app-manifest-checklist.md)
* See [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) and follow the app manifest schema to include the information about your purchasable web app on Teams.
