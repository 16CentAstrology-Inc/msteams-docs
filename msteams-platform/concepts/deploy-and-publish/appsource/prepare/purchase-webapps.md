# Publish purchasable web apps

Teams web apps are free to install, however, some apps require subscription purchasing to experience the application's full functionality and scope. After you submit the web app to AppSource, subsequently Teams enables you to publish your web apps on the App Store for users to purchase them directly from the Teams client experience. These web apps can have any of the capabilities provided by the Teams platform, such as web apps that are available on AppSource.

## How to publish purchasable web app?

Before you start with the publishing process for web apps on Teams, ensure that you familiarize yourself with the following processes:
- [How to submit your app on AppSource](../publish.md)
- [How to create a software as a service (SaaS) offer in the Microsoft commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/create-new-saas-offer)

To publish your purchasable web app, following are the steps involved:

1. Submit your web app to AppSource and pass the validation.
2. Publish your purchasable web app.

After the app is validated and published on AppSource, users can purchase the web app subscription directly from the Teams App Store.

## Submit the web app to AppSource

To submit your web app to the AppSource and subsequently to the Teams App Store, ensure that your web app completes the approval process provided by Microsoft Teams. This approval process verifies whether your web app works as described and contains the relevant metadata and content that is valuable to the users.

For more information on the submission checklist for submitting an app to AppSource, see:

* [Prepare for AppSource submission](submission-checklist.md)
* [Build a great app details page](detail-page-checklist.md)
* [App manifest checklist](app-manifest-checklist.md)
* [Manifest schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) to include the information about your purchasable web app on Teams

## Publish purchasable web apps

After your offer has been submitted on AppSource along with the appropriate plans for the offer, the validation team reviews it and after it passes our validation, the web app is available for you to test and publish it to our commercial marketplace.

After the app is available on our commercial marketplace, your web app (SaaS offer) is automatically available for purchase from the Teams App Store along with AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

## User purchase experience

The purchasable web apps are available for purchase and installation on the Teams App Store.
