# Create required documentation for your Microsoft Teams app

To list your app on the Microsoft Teams store, you must provide the following resources to your users:

- [Privacy policy](#create-a-privacy-policy)
- [Terms of use](#create-a-terms-of-use)
- [Support URLs](#include-support-links)

When a user adds your app, they automatically agree to your privacy policy and terms of use.

## Create a privacy policy

A privacy policy can help your users understand how you handle their data. Use the following checklist when creating your privacy policy:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * The policy can be specific to your Teams app and/or an overall policy for all of your services.
> * If you use a generic privacy policy template, you must reference "services", "applications", and "platforms" to include your Teams app and your website or service.
> * Must include how you handle user data storage, retention, and deletion. You also must describe the security controls you use for data protection.
> * Must include your contact information.
> * Should not contain broken, beta, or staging URLs.

## Create a terms of use

Your terms of use should be specific and applicable to your offering.

## Include support links

Your support URLs should not require authentication for a user to get help or contact you.
