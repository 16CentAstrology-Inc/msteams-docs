# Distribute your Microsoft Teams app

You can provide your Microsoft Teams app to an individual, team, organization, or anyone who wants to use it. How you distribute depends on several factors, including users' needs, business and technical requirements, and your goals for the app.

## Sideload your app in Teams

Use an app or share it with others. Sideloading is the only way to distribute that doesn't require a formal review process.

For more information, see [sideload your app in Teams](apps-upload.md).

## Publish your app to your organization

Make your app available only for people in your org. This kind of distribution requires your Teams admin's approval.

For more information, see [manage your apps in the Teams admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps?toc=%2Fmicrosoftteams%2Fplatform%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2FMicrosoftTeams%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).

### Government Community Cloud (GCC) organizations

In GCC Teams environments, compliant Microsoft apps are enabled by default. Before publishing an app, however, make sure that all the app's endpoints comply with your GCC organization's requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>If your app includes a bot or messaging extension, you must select the **Microsoft Teams for Government** option when setting up a channel between your bot and Teams in Azure. For more information, see [connect a bot to channels](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Publish your app to the Teams store

Make your app available to everyone. This kind of distribution requires Microsoft approval.

For more information, see [publish to the Teams store](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/publish.md).
