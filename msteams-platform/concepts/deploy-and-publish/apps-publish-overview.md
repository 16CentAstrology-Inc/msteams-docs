# Distribute your Microsoft Teams app

You can provide your Microsoft Teams app to an individual, team, organization, or anyone who wants to use it. How you distribute depends on several factors, including your users' needs and the goals you have for the app.

## Sideload your app in Teams

Share your app with a user, group of users, or specific team. For more information, see [sideload your app to Teams](apps-upload.md).

## Publish your app to your organization

Make your app available to your enterprise or Government Community Cloud (GCC) organization.

In the Teams admin center, you can approve or reject custom apps and set up related app permission and setup policies for your organization. For more information, see [manage your apps in the Teams admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps?toc=%2Fmicrosoftteams%2Fplatform%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2FMicrosoftTeams%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).

### Government Community Cloud (GCC) organizations

In GCC Teams environments, compliant Microsoft apps are enabled by default. Before publishing a custom app, however, make sure that all app endpoints comply with your GCC organization's requirements.

If your app includes a bot or messaging extension, you must select the **Microsoft Teams for Government** option when setting up a channel between your bot and Teams in Azure. For more information, see [connect a bot to channels](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Publish your app to Teams store

Make your app available to everyone by [publishing to the Teams store](../../appsource/publish.md).
