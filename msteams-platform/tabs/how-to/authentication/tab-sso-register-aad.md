# Register your tab application in Azure AD

Your Teams app users are authenticated using their Teams user credentials and Azure AD provides an access token for them. You'll need to create a new tab app registration in Azure AD.

This section describes the tasks involved in creating a Teams tab that uses SSO. These tasks are language- and framework-agnostic.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Microsoft Teams Toolkit can to register the Azure AD application in a SSO project.

   In this section, you'll learn how to register and configure the Azure AD app that can be used to implement SSO in a Microsoft Teams tab app.

## Register your app

In this section, you'll learn to create and register an Azure-based Teams tab app.

To register your tab app in Azure AD:

1. Open a web browser to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
   The Microsoft Azure AD Portal page opens.

1. Select **App registrations** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-registrations.png" alt-text="New registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="false":::

    The **Register an application** page appears.

1. Enter the app details for your tab app.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/register-app.png" alt-text="App registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="false":::

    1. Enter the name of your app that will be displayed to the user.
        You can change this name at a later stage, if you want to.

1. Select **Register**.
    A message pops up on the browser stating that the app was created.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-created-msg.png" alt-text="Register app on Azure AD Portal." border="true":::
