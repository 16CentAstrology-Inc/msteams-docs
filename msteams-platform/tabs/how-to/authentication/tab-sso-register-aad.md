# Register your app in Azure AD

Your Teams app users are authenticated and authorized by Azure AD for using your app. Azure AD provides them access to your app based on their Teams identity. You'll need to register your app with Azure AD so that the user who has signed into Teams can be given access to your app.

## Configuration on Azure AD

Registering your app in Azure AD and enabling it for SSO requires making app configurations, such as generating app ID, defining API scope, permissions, and more.

Create a new app registration in Azure AD, and expose its (web) API using scopes (permissions). Configure a trust relationship between the exposed API on Azure AD and your app. It lets users access your app without any further need of consent when your app calls the API using On-behalf-of (OBO) flow. You can add client IDs for the trusted mobile, desktop, and web application that you want to pre-authorize.

These configurations will enable SSO for your app in Teams.

You may also need to configure additional configuration for authenticating users on the platform or device where you want to target your app.

### Before you register with Azure AD

It's helpful to learn about the configuration required for registering your app on Azure AD. It includes the following:

- Single- or multi-tenant options.
- Platform for your app and the URL from where your app is accessible.
- App ID URI, a globally-unique URI used to identify the web API you expose for your app's access through scopes. It's also referred to as an identifier URI.
- Scope, which defines the permissions that an authorized user or your app can be granted for accessing a resource exposed by the API.

Ensure that you've prepared to configure these details before you start registering your app.

The tasks involved in registering a Teams tab app that uses SSO are language- and framework-agnostic.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Teams Toolkit registers the Azure AD application in an SSO project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are some important restrictions that you must know:
>
> - Only user-level Graph API permissions are supported, that is, email, profile, offline_access, OpenId. If you require access to other Graph scopes, such as User.Read or Mail.Read, see [Get an access token with Graph permissions](tab-sso-graph-api.md).
> - Your application's domain name should be the same as the domain name you've registered for your Azure AD application.
> - Currently, multiple domains per app are not supported.

## Create an app registration in Azure AD

Register a new app in Azure AD, and configure the tenancy and app's platform and URI options. You'll generate a new application ID that will be updated later in your Teams app manifest file.

### To register a new app in Azure AD

1. Open a web browser to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
   The Microsoft Azure AD Portal page opens.

2. Select **App registrations** icon.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Azure AD Portal page." border="false":::

   The **App registrations** page appears.

3. Select **+ New registration** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-registrations.png" alt-text="New registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="false":::

    The **Register an application** page appears.

4. Enter the name of your app that will be displayed to the user. You can change this name at a later stage, if you want to.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/register-app.png" alt-text="App registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="false":::

5. Select the types of user accounts that can access your app. You can choose from single- or multi-tenant options, or Private Microsoft account.

    <details>
    <summary>Options for supported account types</summary>

    | Option | Select this to... |
    | --- | --- |
    | Accounts in this organizational directory only  (Microsoft only - Single tenant) | Build an application for use only by users (or guests) in your tenant. <br> Often called a line-of-business (LOB) application, this app is a single-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform. |
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) | Let users in any Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to be able to use your application. This option is appropriate if, for example, you're building a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that you intend to provide to multiple organizations. <br> This type of app is known as a multi-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform.|
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts | Target the widest set of customers. <br> By selecting this option, you're registering a multi-tenant application that can also support users who have personal Microsoft accounts. |
    | Personal Microsoft accounts only | Build an application only for users who have personal Microsoft accounts. Personal Microsoft accounts. |

    </details>

6. Select the **Redirect URI** details.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/redirect-uri.png" alt-text="redirect URI." border="true":::

    1. Select the platform where your app will be accessible. You can choose from **Public client/native (mobile & desktop)**, **Web**, **Single-page application (SPA)**.
    2. Enter URL for your app. After user authentication is successful, Teams uses this URL to open your app.
       You can change this URL at a later stage, if needed.

    <details>
    <summary>Platform and redirect URI options</summary>

    | Option | Select this to... |
    | --- | --- |
    | Web | Configure a redirect URI for your app where client app is redirected. It's also where access token is sent after authentication. <br> Select this platform for standard web applications that run on a server. |
    | Mobile and desktop applications | Configure a redirect URI for mobile applications that aren't using the latest Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) or for desktop applications. |
    | Single-page application | Configure a redirect URI for a client-side web app by using JavaScript or a framework like Angular, Vue.js, React.js, or Blazor WebAssembly. |
    </details>

7. Select **Register**.
    A message pops up on the browser stating that the app was created.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-created-msg.png" alt-text="Register app on Azure AD Portal." border="true":::

    The app is created and displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/tab-app-created.png" alt-text="App registration is successful." border="false":::

8. Note and save the **Application ID**. You'll need it for updating the app manifest.

    Your app is registered in Azure AD. You should now have application ID for your tab app.

## Configure scope for access token

After you've created a new registration, configure scope (permission) options for sending access token to client app. In this section, you'll learn:

- [To expose an API](#to-expose-an-api): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. To do this, you'll expose a web API, and configure the app ID URI.
- [To configure API scope](#to-configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and configure the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure authorized client application](#to-configure-authorized-client-application): Create an authorized client ID for the applications that you want to pre-authorize for your appâ€™s web application. It lets the user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust as your users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.
