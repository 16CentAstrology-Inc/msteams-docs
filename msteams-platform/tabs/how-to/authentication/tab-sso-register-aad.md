# Register your app in Azure AD

Your app users are authenticated and authorized by Azure AD for using your app. Azure AD provides access to your tab app based on the app user's Teams identity. You'll need to register your tab app with Azure AD so that the app user who has signed into Teams can be given access to your tab app.

## Enabling SSO on Azure AD

Registering your tab app in Azure AD and enabling it for SSO requires making app configurations, such as generating app ID, defining API scope, and configuring the OBO flow.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/register-azure-ad.png" alt-text="Configure Azure AD to send access token to Teams Client app" border="false":::

Create a new app registration in Azure AD, and expose its (web) API using scopes (permissions). Configure a trust relationship between the exposed API on Azure AD and your app. It lets app users access your tab app without any further need of consent when your tab app calls the API using On-behalf-of (OBO) flow. You can add client IDs for the trusted mobile, desktop, and web application that you want to pre-authorize.

Azure AD configuration enables SSO for your tab app in Teams. It responds with an access token for validating the app user. You may also need to configure additional configuration for authenticating app users on the platform or device where you want to target your app.

User-level Graph API permissions are supported, that is, email, profile, offline_access, and OpenId. If you require access to other Graph scopes, such as User.Read or Mail.Read, see [Get an access token with Graph permissions](tab-sso-graph-api.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Teams Toolkit registers the Azure AD application in an SSO project.

### Before you register with Azure AD

It's helpful to know about the configuration required for registering your app on Azure AD beforehand. Ensure that you've prepared to configure the following details before you start registering your app:

- **Single- or multi-tenant options**: Your app can be line-of-business (LOB) app, public app, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) application. The tenancy options may differ based on the type of your app and how you want to distribute it.
- **App platform**: Note the platform where your app is available. It also includes noting the URL from where your app is accessible.
- **Application ID URI**: It's a globally-unique URI that identifies the web API you expose for your app's access through scopes. It's also referred to as an identifier URI. The app ID URI includes the app ID and the subdomain where your app is hosted. Your application's domain name and the domain name you register for your Azure AD application should be the same. Currently, multiple domains per app are not supported.
- **Scope**: These are the permissions that an authorized app user or your app can be granted for accessing a resource exposed by the API.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - **LOB applications**: Your organization can make LOB applications available through Microsoft Store. These apps are custom to your organization. They are internal or specific within your organization or business.
> - **Customer-owned apps**: SSO is supported also for customer-owned apps within the Azure AD B2C tenants.

To create and configure your app in Azure AD for enabling SSO:

- [Register and configure the Azure AD app.](#create-an-app-registration-in-azure-ad)
- [Configure scope for access token.](#configure-scope-for-access-token)
- [Configure authentication for different platforms.](#configure-authentication-for-different-platforms)
- [Configure access token version.](#configure-access-token-version)

## Create an app registration in Azure AD

Register a new app in Azure AD, and configure the tenancy and app's platform and URI options. You'll generate a new application ID that will be updated later in your Teams app manifest file.

### To register a new app in Azure AD

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure AD Portal page opens.

2. Select the **App registrations** icon.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Azure AD Portal page." border="true":::

   The **App registrations** page appears.

3. Select **+ New registration** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-registrations.png" alt-text="New registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="true":::

    The **Register an application** page appears.

4. Enter the name of your app that you want to be displayed to the user. You can change this name at a later stage, if you want to.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/register-app.png" alt-text="App registration page on Azure AD Portal." border="true":::

5. Select the types of user accounts that can access your app. You can choose from single- or multi-tenant options, or Private Microsoft account.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Options for supported account types</b></summary>

    | Option | Select this to... |
    | --- | --- |
    | Accounts in this organizational directory only  (Microsoft only - Single tenant) | Build an application for use only by users (or guests) in your tenant. <br> Often called a line-of-business (LOB) application, this app is a single-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform. |
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) | Let users in any Azure AD tenant use your application. This option is appropriate if, for example, you're building a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application, and you intend make it available to multiple organizations. <br> This type of app is known as a multi-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform.|
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts | Target the widest set of customers. <br> By selecting this option, you're registering a multi-tenant application that can support users who have personal Microsoft accounts also. |
    | Personal Microsoft accounts only | Build an application only for users who have personal Microsoft accounts. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your Azure AD app is registered in the same tenant from which you're requesting an authentication in Teams, the app user doesn't need to consent and is granted an access token right away. App users consent to these permissions only if the Azure AD app is registered in a different tenant.

    </details>

6. Select the **Redirect URI** details.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/redirect-uri.png" alt-text="redirect URI." border="true":::

    1. Select the platform where your app will be accessible. You can choose from **Public client/native (mobile & desktop)**, **Web**, **Single-page application (SPA)**.
    2. Enter the URL for your app.
       After user authentication is successful, Azure AD sends the access token to this URL.
       You can change this URL at a later stage, if needed.
    <br>

    <details>
    <summary><b>Platform and redirect URI options</b></summary>

    | Option | Select this to... |
    | --- | --- |
    | Web | Configure a redirect URI for your app where client app is redirected. It's also where access token is sent after authentication. <br> Select this platform for standard web applications that run on a server. |
    | Mobile and desktop applications | Configure a redirect URI for mobile applications that aren't using the latest Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) or for desktop applications. |
    | Single-page application | Configure a redirect URI for a client-side web app by using JavaScript or a framework like Angular, Vue.js, React.js, or Blazor WebAssembly. |
    </details>

7. Select **Register**.
    A message pops up on the browser stating that the app was created.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-created-msg.png" alt-text="Register app on Azure AD Portal." border="true":::

    The page with app ID and other configurations is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/tab-app-created.png" alt-text="App registration is successful." border="true":::

8. Note and save the **Application ID**. You'll need it for updating the Teams Client manifest later.

    Your app is registered in Azure AD. You should now have application ID for your tab app.

## Configure scope for access token

After you've created a new app registration, configure scope (permission) options for sending access token to Teams Client, and the OBO flow to enable SSO.

To configure scope and the OBO flow, you'll need:

- [To expose an API](#to-expose-an-api): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. To do this, you'll expose a web API, and configure the app ID URI.
- [To configure API scope](#to-configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and configure the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure authorized client application](#to-configure-authorized-client-application): Create an authorized client ID for the applications that you want to pre-authorize for your appâ€™s web application. It lets the user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust as your users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

### To expose an API

1. Select **Manage** > **Expose an API** from the left pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/expose-api-menu.png" alt-text="Expose an API menu option." border="true":::

    The **Expose an API** page appears.

1. Select **Set** to generate app ID URI in the form of `api://{AppID}`.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/expose-an-api.png" alt-text="Set app ID URI" border="true":::

    The section for setting app ID URI appears.

1. Enter the app ID URI in the format explained here.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/set-app-id-uri.png" alt-text="Application ID URI" border="true":::

    - The **Application ID URI** displays pre-filled with application ID (GUID) in the format `api://{AppID}`.
    - The app ID URI format should be: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/{AppID}`.
    - Insert the `fully-qualified-domain-name.com` between `api://` and `{AppID}` (which is, GUID). For example, api://example.com/{AppID}.

    where,
    - `fully-qualified-domain-name.com` is the human-readable domain name from which your app is served. Your application's domain name and the domain name you register for your Azure AD application should be the same.

      If you're using a tunneling service, such as ngrok, you must update this value whenever your ngrok subdomain changes.
    - `AppID` is the **Application (client) ID** (GUID) that was generated when you registered your app. You can view it in the **Overview** section.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > - **Application ID URI for app with multiple capabilities**: If you're building an app with a bot, a messaging extension, and a tab, enter the application ID URI as `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/BotId-{YourClientId}`, where the BotID is your bot app ID.
    >
    > - **Format for domain name**: Use lower case letters for domain name. Don't use upper case.
    >
    >   For example, to create an app service or web app with resource name as demoapplication:
    >
    >   | If base resource name used is | URL will be... | Format is supported on... |
    >   | --- | --- | --- |
    >   | *demoapplication* | **<https://demoapplication.azurewebsites.net>** | All platforms.|
    >   | *DemoApplication* | **<https://DemoApplication.azurewebsites.net>** | Desktop, web, and iOS only. It isn't supported in android. |
    >
    >    Use the lower case option *demoapplication* as base resource name.
