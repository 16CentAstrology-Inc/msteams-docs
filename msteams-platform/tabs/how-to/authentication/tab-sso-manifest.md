# Enable SSO in Teams app manifest and preview the app

You've registered your app in Azure AD, and obtained an app ID. You've also configured your code to call `getAuthToken` and handle the access token. Now, you must update the Teams app manifest to enable SSO for your app. The app manifest describes how an app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product.

## webApplicationInfo property

To enable SSO for your app, configure the `webApplicationInfo` property in the Teams app manifest file. This property enables SSO for your app and invokes the OBO flow to help users seamlessly access your app.

:::row:::
  :::column span="2":::
    It has two elements, `id` and `resource`.

    | Element | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | id | You update the app ID (GUID) that you created in Azure AD. |
    | resource | You update your app's subdomain and the app ID URI that you created in Azure AD when creating scope. You can copy the value from **Azure AD** > **Expose an API** section. |

  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="1":::
    <br>

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use manifest version 1.5 or higher to implement the `webApplicationInfo` field.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

The app ID URI that you registered in Azure AD is configured with the scope of the API you exposed. Configure your app's subdomain URI in `resource` to ensure that the authentication request using `getAuthToken` is from the domain given in Teams app manifest.

For more information, please see [webApplicationInfo](/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo).

<summary><b>Learn to create a manifest file</b></summary>

If your app doesn't have a app manifest file, you'll need to create it. To create an app manifest file, use the content shown below to create a .json file named, `manifest.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> The manifest example content shown here is only for a tab app. It uses an ngrok url for subdomain address. For more information, please see [Manifest schema](/resources/schema/manifest-schema).

  }
} 
```

## To configure Teams app manifest for Azure AD registration

1. Open the app project.
2. Open manifest.json.
3. Append the following code snippet to the manifest to add the new property:

    ```json
    "webApplicationInfo": {
    "id": "{Azure AD AppId}",
    "resource": "api://{Subdomain}.example.com/{Azure AD AppId}"
    }
    ```

    where,
    - {Azure AD AppId} is app ID you created when you registered your app in Azure AD. It is the GUID.
    - {{Subdomain}.app ID URI} is the  domain and subdomain of your application. This is the same URI that you registered when creating scope in Azure AD.

4. Update the Azure app ID in the **id** property.
5. Update the subdomain URL in the following properties:
   1. `contentUrl`
   2. `configurationUrl`
   3. `validDomains`
6. Save the app manifest file.

> [!NOTE]
> During build, you can use ngrok to test your app in Azure AD. In that case, you need to replace the subdomain in `api://subdomain.example.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with the ngrok url. For example, api://23c3-103-50-148-128.ngrok.io/bccfbe67-e08b-4ec1-a7fd-e0aaf41a097c.

## Sideload and Preview in Teams

After you update the manifest, you can preview your app in Teams environment.

To preview your app in Teams:

1. Create an app package.

   The app package contains the app manifest and app icons.

2. Open Teams.

3. Select **Teams Store** > **Manage your apps** > **Publish an app**.

    The **Publish an app** options appear.

4. Select **Upload a custom app** to sideload the tab app to Teams.

5. Select your app package to upload.

6. Select **Add**.

    The Tab app is loaded and the consent form appears.

7. Select **Accept**.

    The tab app is loaded and you can use it.

    Congratulations! You have enabled SSO for your tab app.

### Configure code in app settings - Specific to Bot apps

The `appsettings.json` file includes the configuration for Azure AD app.

#### To configure Teams app settings for Azure AD registration

1. Open the app project.
2. Open appsettings.json.
3. Update the `AzureAd` code snippet with configured app details on Azure AD portal:

   ```json
     "AzureAd": {

    "TenantId": "[AzureAD Tenant Id]",
    "ClientId": "[AzureAD Client Id]",
    "AppSecret": "[Azure App secret]",
    "ApplicationIdURI": "[Application ID URI]",
    "AuthUrl": "/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    "ValidIssuers": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/v2.0,https://sts.windows.net/TENANT_ID/"
    },
    ```
    where,
    - `[AzureAD Tenant Id]` is **Directory (tenant) ID**
    - `[AzureAD Client Id]` is **Application (client) ID**
    - `[Azure App secret]` is the **Value** of **Client credentials**, which is client secret
    - `[Application ID URI]` is **Application ID URI**
