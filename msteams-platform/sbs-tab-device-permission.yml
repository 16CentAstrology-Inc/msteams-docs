    Teams app that requires device permissions, such as location, camera, or microphone access, now require users to manually grant permission at a per app level in the web browser. Previously, the browser handled how to grant access permissions, but now these permissions are handled in Microsoft Teams.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to do tab device permission demo at Microsoft Teams. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    * Microsoft Teams with an account (not a guest account)
    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution
    * Visual Studio 2019 or the latest version
    * [Microsoft 365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app

    Configure the tab device permission app at Microsoft Teams.

    **To configure and run your tab device permission app**

    1. Open Git Bash and clone a repository **git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git**. Ensure that you note the **Path** where the repository is cloned.
    1. In the Windows Explorer, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs** folder.
    1. Open **command prompt**, run the below command.

      ```command-prompt
      npm install
      ```
    1. Run the application in the **command prompt** using following command.
       
      ```command-prompt
      npm start
      ```
    1. Begin your tunnelling service to get an https endpoint.
    1. Go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs**.
    1. Start a ngrok tunnel with the following command (you'll need the https endpoint to update the manifest file):

      ```ngrok
      ngrok http 3000--host-header=localhost
      ```  
        
    **To run the tab device permission by uploading the manifest.zip file in Teams**

    1. In the Windows Explorer, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs > appPackage** folder.
    1. Open the **manifest.json** file in visual studio code.
    1. In the **manifest.json** file, find **<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>** and replace it with your https endpoint from ngrok excluding the "https://" part in all the places.

    1. Zip the files in the **appPackage/folder** as manifest.zip.
    1. Go to Teams.
    1. To upload **manifest.zip**, select **Apps > Upload a custom app** and open **manifest.zip**.
