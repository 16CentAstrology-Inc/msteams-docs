# Apps for Teams meetings

Meetings are key to productivity in Microsoft Teams. Meetings enable collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and share feedback in an inclusive and active forum. To enhance the meeting experience, you can create a configurable tab, bot, and messaging extension application. Teams end-users can access apps during meetings using the tab gallery to do either of the following:

* Pre-stage a Kanban board
* Launch an in-meeting actionable dialog
* Create a post-meeting poll

Your meeting app can deliver a user experience for each stage of the meeting lifecycle, depending on the attendee's status.

With meetings extensibility, you can now integrate your apps with meetings and not just within the channels, 1:1 chats, and group chats. Meeting app extensibility includes the various stages of a meeting lifecycle where you can integrate tabs, bots and messaging extensions. It also includes participant roles and user types.

Teams offers users to use API references to work with apps for Teams meetings. It offers users to enable and configure apps, and work in the Microsoft Teams Together Mode. With the Together Mode feature users can collaborate with their team in one place without being separated by boxes.
