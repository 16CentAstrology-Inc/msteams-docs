As a developer, you can have a common shared space for the following:

* [Create a fluid container](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#container-creation)
* [Media synchronization](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#media-synchronizer)
* [See who is online](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#see-who-is-online)
* [Send notifications](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#send-notifications)
* [Role-based state](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#role-based-state)
* [Build a playlist](teams-live-share-sdk-capabilities.md#build-a-playlist)
