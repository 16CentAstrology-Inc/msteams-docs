# Overview

> [!NOTE]
> Live Share SDK is currently available only in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

Live Share SDK helps you to integrate applications and websites with Teams to collaborate, watch, and browse content in a Teams meeting. 
Live Share SDK enables users to discover more ways to collaborate and connect through Teams. Users can share content such as watch a movie, play live games, and so on with each other in Teams one-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.

 <!---Users can share the same collaboration experience as other users in a meeting even if they join after the meeting has already started. For example, three users have started  watching a movie together in a Teams meeting. After 15 minutes, another user who has joined the meeting can sync and continue to watch the movie from the same playback state when the user joined the meeting.--->
