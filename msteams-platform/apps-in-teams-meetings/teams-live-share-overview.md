# Overview

 Teams live share now enables users to discover more ways to collaborate and connect through teams. Users can now share content such as watch a movie, play live games etc. with each other in Teams One-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.

 Users can share the same collaboration experience as other users in a meeting even if they join after the meeting has already started. For example, three users have started  watching a movie together in a Teams meeting. After 15 minutes, another user who has joined the meeting can sync and continue to watch the movie from the same playback state when the user joined the meeting.
