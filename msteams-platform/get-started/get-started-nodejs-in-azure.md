# Host your .NET Teams app in Azure

## You will need:

* **A Microsoft Azure account**. For testing you can use a free trial account and migrate to a production ready account when the app is ready for public use. If you have never used Azure before, you can get started by [creating a new free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). If you already have an Azure account you can use pay-as-you-go to host this app for free.
* **Visual Studio Code**. This free code editor can be downloaded at:[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Once VS Code is installed, add support for Azure deployment by clicking [App service extension](vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice).
* **A downloaded sample app to deploy**. Follow these steps to download and test the *Getting Started with Node.JS* sample app: (~/get-started/get-started-nodejs-app-studio#DownloadAndHost).

## Open the app in VS.Code

Open your preferred shell, and navigate to the root of the sample app *msteams-samples-hello-world-nodejs*, then enter:

```bash
code .
```

VS Code will start, pointing to the root directory for the sample.
