      ### Understand your user

        Understand who your user is and you can identify the right distribution model. It helps you to identify how users use Teams. Ask relevant questions, such as:
        - Do the users primarily use mobile clients?
        - Do you expect many guest users to need access your app?
        - How technically sophisticated are your primary users?

      ### Understand the problem

        Understand the challenges that you want to resolve with your app. Ask relevant questions, such as:
        - What are the pros and cons of the current state system used by your users?
        - What features or capabilities your users prefer in their current system?
        - What issues do you want to address?

      ### List App Requirements and Benefits

        - Do the users need current updates regularly without having to check?
        - Do you need to authenticate users?
        - Do you need to help users with other options?

        Going through a checklist of similar questions helps you craft the right experience. Ask relevant questions, such as:
        - Should only registered users receive regular help?
        - What features or capabilities would be most convenient for user experience?
        - Did the app solve the user's problem?
