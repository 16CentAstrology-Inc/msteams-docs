## Prepare Microsoft Teams for development

There are two possible ways to prepare a Microsoft Teams environment for building your apps:

* Have your organization admin allow to sideload apps into Teams
* Sign up for Office Developer Program and get a new tenant

### Enabling sideloading of apps

To sideload apps that you develop, your organization administrator has to enable the corresponding setting in the administrator settings. [This article](/microsoftteams/admin-settings) describes the settings and how to change them.

### Office Developer Program

In case your organization administrator cannot change the settings for any reason, you can use a test tenant to sideload your apps. [Office 365 Developer Program](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) lets you create test tenants to load and test Office 365 apps that require tenants for developers. [Sign up](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) today to create your own tenant.
