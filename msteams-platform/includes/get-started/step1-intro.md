The [Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/) developer platform makes it easy for you to extend Teams and integrate your own applications or services seamlessly into this workspace. The platform lets you integrate custom applications you develop, for your enterprise or for teams around the world.

To extend Microsoft Teams, you will need to create a Microsoft Teams [app](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview). A Microsoft Teams app is a web application with various capabilities, that you host and can be integrated into the user's workspace in Teams.
