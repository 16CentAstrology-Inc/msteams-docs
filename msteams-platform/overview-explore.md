A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. | Information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. |
| Messaging extensions | Messaging extensions allow the users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search or initiate actions in an external system and you can send back the results of that interaction to the Microsoft Teams client in the form of a richly formatted card. | Reserve a resource and allow the channel to know the reserved time slot, search for a work item in Azure DevOps, and share it with the group as an Adaptive Card, create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to Bob, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details. |
