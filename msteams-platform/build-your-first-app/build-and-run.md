# Build and run your first Microsoft Teams app

Start Microsoft Teams development by building a personal tab that displays "Hello, World!".
Build and run your first Teams app using the following steps:

## 1. Create your app project

Use the Microsoft Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code to set up your first app project. Create your app project using the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Microsoft Teams** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png"::: on the left Activity Bar and choose **Create a new Teams app**.
1. When prompted, sign in with your Microsoft 365 development account.
1. On the **Add capabilities** screen, select **Tab** then **Next**.

1. Enter a name for your Teams app. (This is the default name for your app and also the name of the app project directory on your local machine.)
1. Check only the **Personal tab** option and select **Finish** at the bottom of the screen to configure your project.

## 2. Understand important app project components

Once the toolkit configures your project, you have the components to build a basic personal tab for Teams. The project directories and files display in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

### App scaffolding

The toolkit automatically creates scaffolding for you in the `src` directory based on the capabilities you added during setup.

If you create a tab during setup, for example, the `App.js` file in the `src/components` directory is important because it handles the initialization and routing of your app. It calls the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) to establish communication between your app and Teams.

### App ID

Configure your app with App Studio using the Teams app ID. Find the ID in the `teamsAppId` object, which is located in your project's `package.json` file.

## 3. Build and run your app

Build and run your app locally to save time. This information is also available in the toolkit `README`. Build and run your app using the following steps:

1. In a terminal, go to the root directory of your app project and run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

Once complete, there's a **Compiled successfully!** message in the terminal. Your app is running on `https://localhost:3000`.

## 4. Sideload your app in Teams

Your app is ready to test in Teams. To do this, you must have a Microsoft 365 development account that allows app sideloading. For more information on account opening, see [Teams development account](../build-your-first-app/build-first-app-overview.md#set-up-your-development-account). 

> [!TIP]
> Check for issues before sideloading your app, using the [validation feature in App Studio](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist.md#teams-app-validation-tool), which is included in the toolkit. Fix the errors to successfully sideload the app.

Sideload your app in Teams using the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> To enable sideloading before you sideload your app in Teams, follow the steps in [Turn on app sideloading](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading).

1. Select the **F5** key to launch a Teams web client in Visual Studio Code.
1. To display your app content in Teams, specify that where your app is running (`localhost`) is trustworthy:
   1. Open a new tab in the same browser window (Google Chrome by default) which opened after pressing **F5**.
   1. Go to `https://localhost:3000/tab` and proceed to the page.
1. Go back to Teams. In the dialog, select **Add for me** to install your app.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your app is running in Teams.

## Next step

Expand on the personal tab you just created or build another type of Teams app.
