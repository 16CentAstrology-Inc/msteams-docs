# Overview

The Get Started tutorial teaches you to create basic Teams apps. It contains a series of lessons that begin with building and running a basic app and further introduces you to common tools, fundemental concepts, and more advanced features of Teams.

## What you'll learn

Here's an idea of what you'll know after going through the lessons.

> [!div class="checklist"]
  >
  > * Get up and running quickly with the Teams Toolkit (a Visual Studio Code extension) 
  > * Configure your app with App Studio 
  > * Get experience with Teams tools and SDKs 
  > * Expand on your app such as authentication and design guidelines

## Teams app fundamentals

The [Teams developer platform](../overview.md) lets you build custom apps. Some common scenarios that a custom Microsoft Teams app can help with are: 

* Embed your website or web app directly in the Teams client 
* Help users quickly look up information in another system and add the results to a conversation in Teams 
* Trigger workflows and processes based on a conversation in Teams, preserving the context of the conversation 

Before you begin the tutorials, you should know the following about building apps for Teams.

### App capabilities

A Teams app is made up of one or more [platform capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md) and [and user interactions points](../concepts/extensibility-points.md).

Depending on what capabilities you want for your app, you will need an appropriate development toolset.  

| **App Capabilities**| **User interactions** | **Recommended Tools** | **SDKs** | **Technology stacks** |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tabs | a full-screen embedded web experience  | VS Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or YoTeams (Yeoman Generator) |[Teams client SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client) | Web technology in generalâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript |
| Bots | a chat bot that converse with members | VS Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or YoTeams (Yeoman Generator)  |[Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/) | Node.js, C#, or Python | 
| Messaging Extensions | shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages | VS Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or YoTeams (Yeoman Generator)  | [Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/) | Node.js, C#, or Python |

Tutorials in this Get started section will walk you through with recommended tool sets and commonly used technologies:
* Visual Studio Code with Teams extension
* React.js for tabs
* Node.js for bots and messaging extensions

You are however not limited to using these particular stacks. If you prefer using a command-line interface (CLI), read [Create your first Microsoft Teams app using the Yeoman generator](../tutorials/get-started-yeoman.md)

### Teams doesn't host your app

You will only install an app package that contains a configuration file, called manifest and app icons to Teams client, and the rest of the app logics and data storage are hosted elsewhere, such as Azure Web Services. Your app in the cloud (or localhost during your development) accesses Teams via HTTPS.
