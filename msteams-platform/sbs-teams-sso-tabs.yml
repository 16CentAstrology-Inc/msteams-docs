    Implement Teams SSO in your Microsoft Teams tab app.
    You'll create a tab app and configure it to authenticate app users with Teams SSO.

   Here's a list of prerequisites for authenticating your app users with Teams SSO for your tab app:

   1. A Teams tab app: You can use the Get started sample available for Teams Toolkit and Visual Studio Code to build a sample tab app.

   1. Register your tab app with Azure AD: Your Teams app users are authenticated using their Teams user credentials and Azure AD provides an access token for them.

   1. Update the manifest file: After you register your app in Azure AD, update the app properties in your app's manifest file.

   1. Get an access token: This step requires your app user to give their consent for using their credentials for user-level permission. Azure AD receives the user credentials and sends an access token to Teams.

   The token is parsed in the tab application using JavaScript, to extract required information, such as the user's email address.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The getAuthToken() is only valid for consenting to a limited set of user-level APIs that is email, profile, offline_access, and OpenId. It is not used for further Graph scopes such as User.Read or Mail.Read. For suggested workarounds, see Get an access token with Graph permissions.

   This section describes the tasks involved in creating a Teams tab that uses SSO. These tasks are language- and framework-agnostic. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Microsoft Teams Toolkit can to register the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application in a single sign-in (SSO) project.

   In this exercise, you'll learn how to manually register and configure the Azure AD app that can be used to implement SSO in a Microsoft Teams app.

   To complete the registration of your tab app in Azure AD:

   1. [Register your app](#register-your-app)
   1. Configure authentication
   1. Create a client secret
   1. Configure API permissions with Microsoft Graph
   1. Expose an API for the app and define app scope
