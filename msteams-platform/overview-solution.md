# The Teams solution

Now that weâ€™ve had a view of Teams offerings, letâ€™s see how it maps to user needs. Letâ€™s go back to our scenario.

## The user story

The user wants to build an app that checks and sends the weather updates to the users, the tourists, so that they can plan their travel. The main requirement is that the app should send the weather update to the user a day prior to the travel.

Let's collate some known requirements:

1. The user requires information about their travel.
1. The user should receive a weather update a day before travel.
1. The user should be registered.

A Teams personal bot application that uses authentication features checks all these requirements.

Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution.
