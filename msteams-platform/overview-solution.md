# The Teams solution

Now that weâ€™ve had a view of Teams offerings, letâ€™s see how it maps to user needs. Letâ€™s go back to our scenario.

## The user story

The user wants to build an app that checks and sends the weather updates to the users, the tourists, so that they can plan their travel. The main requirement is that the app should send the weather update to the user a day prior to the travel.

Let's collate and map requirements to Teams features:

| User app needs | Check weather | Notification before travel | Registered user |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Capabilities** | Bot | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Integraion** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Microsoft Graph |
| **Scope** | &nbsp; | Personal app | &nbsp; |
| **Entry point** | &nbsp; | Chat | &nbsp; |
|

**App solution**: A Teams personal chat bot application that uses checks and sends weather notification to registered and authenticated users before their travel date checks all these requirements.

Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution.
