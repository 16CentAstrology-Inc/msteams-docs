# The Teams solution

Now that you've had a view of Teams offerings, you can map them to user needs. Letâ€™s revisit the user scenario.

## The user story

The developer from Travel agency wants to build an app for their users, the tourists. It should check and send the forecast to users registered with the travel agency. The app should notify the users a day before the travel so they can plan.

Collate and map requirements to Teams features:

| User app needs | Check forecast | Notification before travel | Registered user |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Capability** | Bot | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Integration** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Microsoft Graph; Forecast website |
| **Scope** | &nbsp; | Personal app | &nbsp; |
| **Entry point** | &nbsp; | Chat | &nbsp; |
|

**App solution**: A Teams *personal chat bot* app that uses checks and *sends forecast notification* to *registered users* before their travel date checks all requirements.

Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution.
