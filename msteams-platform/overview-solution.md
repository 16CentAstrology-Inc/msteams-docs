# The Teams solution

The Microsoft Teams Platform is a powerful, flexible platform for creating apps for Microsoft Teams. It provides a vast suite of development environments and tools to support app development.

## The user story

Now that you've had a view of Teams offerings, you can map them to user needs. Letâ€™s revisit the user scenario.

The developer from Tours and Travel agency wants to build an app for their users, the travelers. The app should:

- Check and send the forecast to travelers registered with the travel agency.
- Notify the users a day before the departure date so they can plan.

Collate and map requirements to Teams features:

| User app needs | Check forecast | Notification before travel | Registered user |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Capability** | Bot | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Integration** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Microsoft Graph; Forecast website |
| **Scope** | &nbsp; | Personal app; Adaptive Card | &nbsp; |
| **Integration point** | &nbsp; | Chat | &nbsp; |
|

**Teams app solution**: A Teams *personal chat bot* app, which checks and *sends forecast notification* in an *Adaptive Card* to *registered users* before their travel date, checks all requirements.

Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution. To develop this app:

1. Create a personal chat bot app.
1. Integrate with external API from a forecast website to connect and request forecast for specific date and location.
1. Integrate with Microsoft Graph for registered users.
1. Check and send forecast details on the basis of users travel date and travel location on a particular day.

## Choose what suits you

You can build a Teams app as per your app's requirements. Based on factors, such as business needs, development environment, domain knowledge, select the environment and tools you want to build your app.

A Teams app offers you the flexibility of choosing your build environment. This includes tools, framework, and languages to approach your app development.
