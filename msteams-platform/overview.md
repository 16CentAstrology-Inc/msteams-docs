# Build apps with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.

Apps are how you extend Teams capabilities to fit your needs. Create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app.

## Why build your apps with Teams?

A Teams app brings your users the advantages of a collaborative workspace.

As a platform for building apps, Teams offers the full range of apps and toolkits. From planning your app to distributing it, the Teams framework supports you at every stage.
