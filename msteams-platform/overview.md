# The Microsoft Teams developer platform

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that integrates with the apps and services that teams use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy for you to integrate your own service, whether you develop custom apps for your enterprise or SaaS applications for teams around the world.

By using Microsoft Teams, each group in an organization can create structures that fit their roles and projects.

* **Teams** are collections of people, content, and tools focused on specific projects or jobs.
* In each team, **channels** keep conversations organized in whatever way works best for that team, such as by topic, project, or discipline.

For more detail, see [Overview of teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-channels-overview).

> [!TIP]
> Don't have Microsoft Teams? Get a free Office 365 developer subscription or activate it for your existing Office 365 account. See [Set up your Office 365 tenant](~/get-started/get-started#1-set-up-your-office-365-tenant).

## Apps in Microsoft Teams

To extend Microsoft Teams by adding your content and services, you can create a Microsoft Teams app&mdash;a package of capabilities that you host and that can be distributed through Microsoft Teams or installed by individual teams.

To learn about Teams apps and all the possibilities they offer, see [Develop apps for Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview).

## Custom bots

For quick one-off integration of your existing webhook, you can take advantage of our *custom bot* feature to set up webhooks and notifications in a specific team. You can use custom bots for workflows and commands, such as kicking off a build or checking the latest set of live-site issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom bots simply leverage your existing web services. To take advantage of other capabilities, such as non-messaging APIs, asynchronous posting, or adding button actions to cards, see [Develop bots for Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/bots/bots-overview).

To learn about custom bots, see [Custom bots in Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/custom-bot).
