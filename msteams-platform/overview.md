# An App that fits

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work. Apps are how you extend Teams capabilities to fit your needs. Create something brand new or integrate an existing app — and you utilize benefits of Microsoft Teams platform for your particular business needs.

## Driving organizational goals

||Add details for different business scenarios and business benefits||

Collaboration and communication are key for an organization. Concise communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility is why organizations are increasingly choosing to rely on apps.

Organizations use it to connect with their customers, provide services, and share information. But that's not all! Apps are the meeting place for people to work together. A well-placed app helps build a cohesive environment for external and internal business needs.

Let's look at some areas that where an app meets the need.

- **Business benefit and opportunities**: More users and customers for your service!
    - Extending existing apps and system – e.g. Adobe for Teams

## Build apps with Microsoft Teams platform

Microsoft Teams apps help your collaborative workspace to be more productive by bringing key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.

Here's why Teams is best-suited for your app needs:

- **Communication & collaboration**

    Most successful Teams apps involve either some form of pulling information in from another system, having a conversation about it, and allowing users to take action about that information from directly within the Teams client, or pushing information to a targeted audience based on an event or action in an external system.

- **Social interactions**

    Teams is a social platform; custom social-focused apps encourage your team to extend your company culture into your collaboration space. Apps that send polls, let people send feedback to each other, connect them together, or are just for fun (don't underestimate the power of a few "just for fun" apps can have on team morale).

- **Common business processes**

    Things like creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking your time against a project, reserving common resources, submitting help desk requests and more can make for effective Teams apps.

- **Surface existing app**

    If you've got an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application it may make sense to enable some or all of it in Teams.

- **Personal apps with tabs and bots**

    One-to-one conversational bots are one of the more open-ended extensibility points within Microsoft Teams. The conversation is just between the bot and your user, you have the flexibility of including task modules to simplify complex sets of information.
