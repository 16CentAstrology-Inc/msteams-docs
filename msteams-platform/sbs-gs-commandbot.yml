   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.


   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/teams-toolkit.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation." border="false":::

    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code sidebar after it's installed.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar." border="false":::

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for sideloading option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you won't be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Publish an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't have the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft" border="true":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/command-bot.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the app created." border="true":::

        After your app is created, Teams Toolkit displays a message to indicate the location where the project workspace is created. This folder is the default location specified in Visual Studio Code settings.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/location-change.png" alt-text="Location message" border="true":::

        The message offers two options:
        
        - **Change location**
        - **Local Debug**

        > [!NOTE]
        > For this tutorial, you don't need to use these options. If you choose to change the location for workspace, it's reflected only for projects you create after reloading Visual Studio Code. No change is made to the location of existing projects.

    1. Select **Run and Debug** :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/run-debug-icon.png"::: icon from the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/final-output.png" alt-text="final-output" border="true":::      

    ## Take a tour of the tab app source code

    Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the **Explorer** area of Visual Studio Code.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/folder-structure.png" alt-text="structure tab" border="true":::

    Although you're free to choose any UI framework (or not to use any), this sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components. The Toolkit maintains:

    | File name | Contents |
    | --- | --- |
    | `bot/src/internal/initialize.js` | Create the global bot adapter and initialize with Teams Frameworks |
    | `bot/src/index.js` | Server code to host the bot app and listen on /api/messages to process Teams activity with Bot Framework |
    | `bot/src/helloworldCommandHandler.js` | A hello world command handler to process a helloworld command and return an adaptive card as response |

    You've learned to build, and run Teams app with Command bot capabilities. The final step is to deploy your app on Azure.

    Let's deploy the first app with Command bot capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use this account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and to provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder in which you created the Command bot app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the sidebar.
    1. Select **Sign in to Azure**.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the Azure Account extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step. Use the same account as you are using in other extensions.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account.
    1. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials.
    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

        The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure you have at least one usable Azure subscription available.

        Now you're ready to deploy your app to Azure!

    ## Deploy your app to Azure

      In Deployment, necessary cloud resources are created in provisioning and your app's code is copied into the created cloud resources.

    1. Select the Teams Toolkit :::image type="icon" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

    1. Select **Provision in the Cloud**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/provision-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the provisioning commands" border="true":::

    1. Select a subscription to use for the Azure resources.
    
        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/subscription-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing resources for provisioning" border="true":::

       A dialog warns you that costs may be incurred when running resources in Azure.

    1. Select **Provision**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/provision-confirm.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the provisioning dialog." border="true":::

       The provisioning process creates resources in the Azure cloud. It may take some time. You can monitor the progress by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see the following notice:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/deploy-provision-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the provisioning complete dialog." border="true":::

         If you want you can view the provisioned resources. For this tutorial, you don't need to view resources.

         The provisioned resource appears in the **Environment** section.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/provisioned-resources-env.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the provisioning complete dialog." border="true":::

    1. Select **Deploy to the Cloud** from the **Deployment** panel after provisioning is complete.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/deploy-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the where to click to deploy to cloud." border="true":::

          A dialog confirms the deploy resources in dev environment.

    1. Select **Deploy**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/Deploy-confirm.png" alt-text="Deploy to confirm." border="true":::

          As with provisioning, deployment takes some time. You can monitor the process by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see a completion notice.

    ## Run the deployed app

    Once the provisioning and deployment steps are complete:

    1. Open the debug panel (**Ctrl+Shift+D** / **⌘⇧-D** or **View > Run**) from Visual Studio Code.
    1. Select **Launch Remote (Edge)** from the launch configuration drop-down.
    1. Select the **Play** button to start debugging.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/remote-debug.png" alt-text="Remote Debug." border="true":::

        You'll get the following output in Teams:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/app-cloud-output.png" alt-text="App cloud output." border="true":::

    1. Select **Add to a team** from the drop-down list:
    
        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/app-cloud-output1.png" alt-text="App cloud output1" border="true":::

        You'll get the following helloWorld command in the app:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/hello-world-cloud.png" alt-text="Hello World Command" border="true":::

    1. Select the command and select **Enter**.  

        You'll receive the following command response in adaptive card:

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/cloud-final-output.png" alt-text="Cloud final output" border="true":::
