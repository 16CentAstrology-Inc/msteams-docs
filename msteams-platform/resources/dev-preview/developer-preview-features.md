# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

As of 04/26/2018 these are the new features in Developer Preview. When new items are added they will be listed here.

## Adding tabs and bots to groups

This feature allows you to:

* Add tabs to group chats
* Add bots to group chats

### Known issues

If you upload an app with a bot to a chat in Developer Preview and you switch back to the public version, the same chat will have the compose box disabled. To fix this, you need to uninstall the app in group chat.
Input menus do not currently work with “groupchat” scope.
Deeplinks into tabs in group chat doesn’t work.

See [What is the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams?](~/resources/general/developer-preview) for more information on enabling it for your development tenant.
