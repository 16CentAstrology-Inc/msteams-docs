# oEmbed Filter

The oEmbed filter enhances user experience by simplifying inclusion of the external HTML content within Moodle. The advantages of oEmbed filter are as follows: 

* Reduces the time for an instructor to embed videos to an HTML page.
* Enables embedding of multiple video content providers.
* Doesn't require a technical understanding of how to copy and embed code from any of the supported services.
* Doesn't require a YouTube API key for video embedding.
