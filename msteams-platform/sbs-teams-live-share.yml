    For this tutorial, use the [Agile poker](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/tree/main/samples/22.react-agile-poker) sample to get started. You can clone the Teams live share sdk repository using the following commands:
    
    1. Add the latest version of the SDK to your application using npm.

     ```
     npm install @microsoft/live-share--save

     ```

    2. Clone the repository to test the sample.

    ```
     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk.git
   
    ```

    After you've cloned the Teams live share SDK repository, you can build and test the Teams live share tab in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:

    1. [Build and run the sample](#build-and-run-the-sample)

    1. [Create ngrok tunnel](#create-ngrok-tunnel)

    ## Build and run the sample

    After the repository is cloned, you can build the sample app.

    1. Open a terminal window.

    1. Go to the sample of your choice.

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\22.react-agile-poker
        ```
    1. Install the dependency package.

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Start the client and a local server.

        ```
        npm run start
        ```

    A new browser tab opens a http://localhost:3000 window and the agile poker game appears.

    ## Create ngrok tunnel

    After you install ngrok, you have to create a tunnel to deploy your app locally.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3000.

        ```
        ngrok http 3000 --host-header=localhost
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example of ngrok tunnel.

   You need to setup the manifest file and upload the zip package to Teams.

     1. Go to the **manifest.json** file in your sample app folder.
  
     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio Code and update the configuration URL.
       
        Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-live-share/agile-poker-configuration-url.png" alt-text="update configuration url":::

      1. Update the following in the manifest:

          * Set `developer.name` to your name
          * Update `developer.websiteUrl` with your website
          * Update `developer.privacyUrl` with your privacy policy
          * Update `developer.termsOfUseUrl` with your terms of use
      
      1. Zip the contents of the **manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > Ensure that the `manifest.zip` contains only `manifest json` source file, `color` icon, and `outline` icon inside the zip folder.
