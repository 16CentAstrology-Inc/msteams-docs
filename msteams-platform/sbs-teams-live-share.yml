    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:
 
    * [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/log-in) with a valid account
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution

   To download the sample:
  
    For this tutorial, use the [Agile Poker](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/tree/main/samples/22.react-agile-poker) sample to get started. You can download and clone it from GitHub.

    1. Add the latest version of the SDK to your application using NPM.

     ```
     npm install @microsoft/live-share--save

     ```

    1. Clone the repository to test samples and/or build the packages.

    ```
     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk.git
   
    ```

    After you've cloned the repo for Teams live share SDK, you can build and test the Teams live share tab in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:

    1. [Build and run the sample](#build-and-run-the-sample)

    1. [Create ngrok tunnel](#create-ngrok-tunnel)

    ## Build and run the sample

    After the repository is cloned, you can build the sample app.

    1. Open a terminal window.

    1. Navigate to the sample of your choice.

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\22.react-agile-poker
        ```
    1. Install the dependency package.

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Start both the client and a local server.

        ```
        npm run start
        ```

    A new browser tab will open to http://localhost:3000 and you will see the agile poker appear in the browser.

    ## Create ngrok tunnel

    After you install ngrok, you can create a tunnel to deploy your app locally.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3000.

        ```
        ngrok http 3000 --host-header=localhost
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example of ngrok tunnel.

        *Ngrok* listens to requests from the internet and will route them to your app running on port 8080.

- title: Set up manifest file and upload your app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

     1. Navigate to **manifest.json** in cloned repository.
  
     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio and update the configuration URL.
       
        Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok excluding the https:// part in all the places.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-live-share/agile-poker-configuration-url.png" alt-text="update configuration url":::

      1. Update the following in the manifest:

          * Set `developer.name` to your name.
          * Update `developer.websiteUrl` with your website.
          * Update `developer.privacyUrl` with your privacy policy.
          * Update `developer.termsOfUseUrl` with your terms of use.
      
      1. Zip the contents of the **Manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > The `manifest.zip` shouldn't contain any additional folders in it. It should have `manifest json` source file, `color` icon, and `outline` icon inside the zip folder.
        > Upload your manifest in your demo tenant for organization or your Teams account and run your solution in Visual Studio.
