   Live share SDK now allows you to build collaborative apps and discover more ways to collaborate and connect through teams. Developers can now build apps where you can share content together such as watching a movie, playing live games etc. in Teams one-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.
  
   This step-by-step guide helps you to create a Live Share sample app. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:
 
    * [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/log-in) with a valid account
    * [Latest version of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Latest version on nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [Latest version of ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you are downloading ngrok for the first time, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    For this tutorial, use the [Agile poker](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/tree/main/samples/22.react-agile-poker) sample to get started. You can clone the Live Share sdk repository using the following commands:

    1. Clone the Live Share SDK repository to test the sample.

    ```
     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk.git
   
    ```

    After you've cloned the Live Share SDK repository, you can build and test the Agile poker app in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:

    1. [Build and run the sample](#build-and-run-the-sample)

    1. [Create ngrok tunnel](#create-ngrok-tunnel)

    ## Build and run the sample

    After the repository is cloned, start building the Agile poker app.

    1. Open a terminal window.

    1. Go to the Agile poker app sample folder.

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\22.react-agile-poker
        ```
    1. Install the dependency package.

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Start the client and a local server.

        ```
        npm run start
        ```

    A new browser tab opens a http://localhost:3000 window and the agile poker game appears.

    ## Create ngrok tunnel

    After you install ngrok, you have to create a tunnel to deploy your app locally.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3000.

        ```
        ngrok http 3000 --host-header=localhost
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example of ngrok tunnel.

   You need to setup the manifest file and upload the zip package to Teams.

     1. Go to the **manifest.json** file in your sample app folder.
  
     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio Code and update the configuration URL.
       
        Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-live-share/agile-poker-configuration-url.png" alt-text="update configuration url":::
      
     1. Zip the contents of the **manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Ensure that the `manifest.zip` contains only `manifest json` source file, `color` icon, and `outline` icon inside the zip folder.
     
     ## Upload your app in Teams meeting

      1. Go to **Teams**.

      1. Schedule a meeting from the calendar in Teams.
         Ensure you invite minimum 1 attendee to the meeting.
