# Buttons, links, and controls

---

## Button types

The way buttons are styled helps communicate what kind of action they trigger. We maintain a wide range of buttons that are formatted to show different levels of emphasis.

Buttons can have text, an icon, or a combination of text and an icon. To communicate different levels in a hierarchy, we designed primary and secondary buttons within each category.

### Text buttons

In dialogs, you should align buttons to the right, starting with the primary action farthest to the right. In cards, buttons are left-aligned.

Icon buttons
Icon buttons can invoke an action and can also be toggled on and off.


In some cases, you can pair an icon and text to increase emphasis.


Miscellaneous buttons
Radial buttons, checkboxes, and toggles.


Links
Here are our approved styles for inline text links.


Style
Size and padding
Text buttons, icons, and controls are contained within a 32px high container to ensure all controls are visually aligned and consistent.


Rounded corners
Text buttons have a corner radius of 3px.


Button text
Use sentence case in text for buttons to help with localization and legibility. (In other words, only capitalize the first letter of the first word in a phrase or sentence.)
