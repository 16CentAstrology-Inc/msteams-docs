    Teams bot are conversational bots that run repetitive automated tasks performed by the users, such as customer service. The user needs to sign in with their credentials multiple times for performing repetitive tasks. The Single sign-on (SSO) authentication method in Azure Active Directory (AAD) silently refreshes the authentication token. This results in reduction of the number of times users need to enter their sign-in credentials. 
    
    A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

    * Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the user to @mention the bot.
    * Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to the bot.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with SSO authentication enabled. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    * Microsoft Teams with an account (not a guest account)
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution
    * Visual Studio 2019 or the latest version
    * [Microsoft 365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app

- title: Set up bot in Azure Bot Service
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    To authenticate the bot with SSO, you can set up bot in Azure Bot Service. Register bot with Azure Bot Service when you develop and host it in Azure. To do this, perform the following:

    * Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    * Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot Service.
    * Create client secret that enables SSO authentication of the bot.
    * Expose API endpoint to specify the location from where the resources can be accessed.
    * Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    * Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. In the search box, enter **Azure bot** and select the Enter key.
    1. Select **Azure Bot**.

        You have set up a bot in Azure Bot Service and now you need to setup a bot service connection.
    
- title: Set up Bot Service connection
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |
    When you register a bot in Azure, it creates an Active Directory (AD) registration application. This application has an app ID `MicrosoftAppId` and a client secret `MicrosoftAppPassword`. You use these values for bot configuration and also generate an authentication connection. You add this connection to the bot resource you created. With Azure Bot Service’s OAuth, it's easier for your Teams bot to sign in your users and access external data providers.

    **To configure Bot Service connection**

    1. Select **Add OAuth Connection Settings**.
    1. Enter the following details in **New Connection Setting**:
        - Enter **Name** for your new connection setting. You can use the name in the settings of your bot service code.
        - Select **Azure Active Directory V2** from **Service Provider**.
        - Enter **Client id** and **Client secret** saved previously as your Microsoft App ID and Value for Client secret respectively.

            > [!NOTE]
            > You can obtain the Microsoft App ID from the bot's Configuration page.

        - For the **Token Exchange URL**, use the **Application ID URL** obtained previously while exposing API endpoint.
        - Enter **common** as the **Tenant ID**.
        - Enter **User.Read** and also add all the **Scopes** required while specifying permissions to downstream APIs.

            ![Bot Service connection](~/assets/images/bots/botserviceconnection.png)

    1. Select **Save**.
    1. Select **Apply**.

        Troubleshooting

- title: Configure and run the Teams app
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes.
    
    Configure and run the Teams app either by:

    * Uploading the **manifest.zip** file.
    * Using **App Studio**.

    In Visual Studio, edit the **manifest.json** file in the **appPackage/** folder. Replace everywhere you see the place holder string **{TODO: MicrosoftAppId}** with your Microsoft App ID.
    
    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**
    
    1. Go to apppackage folder. In Visual Studio, edit the **manifest.json** file in the **appPackage/** folder. Replace everywhere you see the place holder string **{TODO: MicrosoftAppId}** with your Microsoft App ID.
    1. Zip the contents of the **appPackage/** folder to create a **manifest.zip**.
    1. Upload **manifest.zip** to Teams by selecting **Store**, **Manage your apps**, and **Upload a custom app**.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The Bot exchanges an SSO token and makes a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returns the results. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**.

    1. Send a message to the bot.

        ![Authentication bot](~/assets/images/bots/authenticationbotcreated.png)

        The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

        ![Permissions to bot](~/assets/images/bots/permissions.png)

    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.
    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.

    **To run the Teams app using App Studio**

    1. In Teams, open your app's zip file in **App Studio's** manifest editor.
    1. Select **Bots** under **Capabilities**.
    1. Check the **Bot ID**.
    1. Select **Domains and permissions** under **Finish**.
    1. Check the **AAD App ID**, which is the Microsoft App ID and **Single-Sign-On** includes the Microsoft App ID with **api://botid-** added to it.
    1. Select **Test and distribute** under **Finish** and select **Install**.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**. The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

    1. Send a message to the bot.
    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.
    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.
