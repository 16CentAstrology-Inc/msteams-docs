    A bot referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot is an app that runs simple and repetitive automated tasks. These tasks are performed by the users, such as by customer service. A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

    * Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the user to @mention the bot to invoke it in a channel.
    * Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to your bot.
    
    The step-by-step guide helps you to get started with Single sign-on (SSO) in a bot using Bot Framework. Single sign-on authentication in Azure Active Directory (AAD) silently refreshes the authentication token. SSO reduces the number of times users need to enter their sign in credentials.
    
    The lessons begin with setting up bot SSO in Azure Bot Service. These lessons guide you to use Bot Framework support for OAuth SSO in your bot. The bot is developed to authenticate users to various identity providers, such as Azure Active Directory (AAD) and GitHub. The tutorial provides steps to enable Bot SSO, which helps to set up Azure Bot Services. You'll see the following output:

- title: Set up bot in Azure Bot Service
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    Register a bot with the Azure Bot Service when you develop and host it in Azure.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource** under **Azure services**.
    1. In the search box, enter **Azure bot** and select the **Enter** key.

        ![Create resource Azure bot](~/assets/images/bots/Azurebotcreate.png)

    1. If the validation passes, select **Create**.

        It takes a few moments for your bot service to be provisioned.

    1. Select **Go to resource**. The bot and the related Azure Key Vault resources are listed in the resource group you selected.
    1. Select **Download from GitHub** to download the SDK and build your bot with the Bot Framework SDK.

        ![Build Bot Framework SDK](~/assets/images/bots/buildfromgithub.png)

    **To add messaging endpoint**

    1. Select **Configuration** under **Settings** for the Azure bot that you created.
    1. In **Messaging endpoint**, use the HTTPS URL available from ngrok and at the end of the URL add **/api/messages**.
    1. Select **Apply**.

    
- title: Set up Bot Service connection
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |
    When you register a bot in Azure using Bot Channels Registration, Azure creates an Active Directory (AD) registration application. This application has an app ID (MicrosoftAppID) and a client secret (MicrosoftAppPassword). You use these values for bot configuration. You also generate an authentication connection. You add this connection to the bot channel registration settings.

    1. Select **Add OAuth Connection Settings**.
    1. Enter the following details in **New Connection Setting**:
        - Enter **Name** for your new connection setting. This name is referenced in the settings of your bot service code.
        - Select **Azure Active Directory V2** from **Service Provider**.
        - Enter **Client id** and **Client secret** saved previously as your Microsoft App ID and Value for Client secret respectively.

            > [!NOTE]
            > The Microsoft App ID can be obtained from the bot's Configuration page.

        - For the **Token Exchange URL**, use the **Application ID URL** obtained previously while exposing API endpoint and add **api://botid-** at the beginning of the URL.
        - Enter **common** as the **Tenant ID**.
        - Add all the **Scopes** required while specifying permissions to downstream APIs.

            ![Bot Service connection](~/assets/images/bots/botserviceconnection.png)

    1. Select **Save**.
    1. Select **Apply**.

- title: Configure and run your bot sample
  durationInMinutes: 1

    Configure the bot sample to understand how to use authentication for a bot running in Microsoft Teams.

    1. Clone the repository with the following command or using Visual Studio 2019.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
        ```

    1. In Visual Studio, select **File -> Open -> Project/Solution**.
    1. Go to the **samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/csharp_dotnetcore** folder of **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** repository.
    1. Open the **BotSSOCSharp.csproj** file.
    1. Open the **appsettings.json** file.
    1. Update the **appsettings.json** configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App ID and App Password generated previously. Use the OAuth connection name as the **Connection Name**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The Microsoft App ID can be obtained from the bot's Configuration page. The App Password is the Value for Client secret that you saved previously.

    1. Select the **F5** key to run this project.

- title: Configure and run the Teams app
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes.
    
    Configure and run the Teams app either by:

    * Uploading the **manifest.zip** file
    * Using App Studio

    Edit the **manifest.json** file in the **appPackage/** folder. Replace everywhere you see the place holder string **{TODO: MicrosoftAppId}** with your Microsoft App ID.
    
    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**

    1. Zip the contents of the **appPackage/** folder to create a **manifest.zip**.
    1. Upload **manifest.zip** to Teams by selecting **Store**, **Manage your apps**, and **Upload a custom app**.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The Bot exchanges an SSO token and makes a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returns the results. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**.

        ![Authentication bot](~/assets/images/bots/authenticationbotcreated.png)

        The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

        ![Permissions to bot](~/assets/images/bots/permissions.png)

    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.
    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.

    **To run the Teams app using App Studio**

    1. In Teams, open your app's zip file in **App Studio's** manifest editor.
    1. Select **Bots** under **Capabilities**.
    1. Check the **Bot ID**.
    1. Select **Domains and permissions** under **Finish**.
    1. Check the **AAD App ID**, which is the Microsoft App ID and **Single-Sign-On** includes the Microsoft App ID with **api://botid-** added to it.
    1. Select **Test and distribute** under **Finish** and select **Install**.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**. The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.
    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.
