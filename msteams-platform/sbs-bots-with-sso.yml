    Teams bots are conversational bots that run repetitive automated tasks done by the users, such as customer service. The user needs to sign in with their credentials multiple times for performing repetitive tasks. The Single sign-on (SSO) authentication method in Azure Active Directory silently refreshes the authentication token. This results in reduction of the number of times users need to enter their sign-in credentials. 
    
    A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

    * Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the user to @mention the bot.
    * Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to the bot.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with SSO authentication enabled. You'll see the following output:

- title: Configure and run the Teams app
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the `manifest.zip` file.

    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**
    
    1. In Visual Studio, go to the `appPackage/` folder.
    1. Open the `manifest.json` file.
    1. In the `manifest.json` file, find **{TODO: MicrosoftAppId}** and replace it with your Microsoft App ID.
    1. In Windows Explorer, go to the **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > bot-conversation-sso-quickstart > csharp_dotnetcore > appPackage** folder.
    1. Zip the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create `manifest.zip`.
    1. Go to Teams.
    1. To upload `manifest.zip`, select **Store > Manage your apps > Upload a custom app** and open `manifest.zip`.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The Bot exchanges an SSO token and makes a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returns the results. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**.

    1. Send a message to the bot. The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

        ![Permissions to bot](~/assets/images/bots/sbsdesktop-mobile-consent-request.png)

    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.

    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.
