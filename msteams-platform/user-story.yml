    ## Teams App Features 

    | Feature | Description | Useful for |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |Tabs | Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. You can add them as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. | Personal tab, channel or group tab, stage view, and link unfurling |
    | Bots | A bot is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It's an app that runs simple and repetitive automated tasks done by the users. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. | Customer service, information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. |
    | Messaging extensions | Messaging extensions allow the users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They search or start actions in an external system. You can send the result of the interaction to the Microsoft Teams client as a richly formatted card. | Reserve a resource and allow the channel to know the reserved time slot. Search for a work item in Azure DevOps, and share it with the group as an Adaptive Card. Create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to Bob, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details. |
    |Meeting extensions | You can create apps to make meetings more productive. | Ask people to complete a survey during a call or send a quick reminder that doesn’t interrupt the flow of the meeting. |
    | Personal app | A personal app is a dedicated space (tab) or bot to help users focus on their own tasks or view activities important to them. | OneNote is a personal app that gives you a private workspace within Teams. Planner offers a bird's eye view of all your tasks, across boards that you or your team have added as channel tabs. |
    | Webhooks and connectors | Communicate with external apps, and send or receive notifications and messages from other apps. | Subscribe to receive notifications and messages from your web services. |
    | Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365 and can be incorporated in any kind of Teams app. | Create, manage, find, and archive large number of teams and populate them with users and channels |
    | Adaptive Card | Cards help you organize information into groups and give users the opportunity to interact with specific parts of the information | Add use case |
    | Task modules | Task modules permit you to create modal pop-up experiences in your Teams application. | Run your own custom HTML or JavaScript code. Show an <`iframe`>-based widget such as a YouTube or Microsoft Stream video. |

    ## App scope

    Teams lets you determine the scope of app usage - on an individual level or in a collaborative context.

    - Personal app experience: A personal app is a dedicated space or bot to help users focus on their own tasks or view activities important to them.
    - Shared app experience: Team, channel, and chat are collaboration spaces. Apps in these contexts are available to everyone in that space. Collaboration spaces typically focus on workflows for your app's interactions or unlocking new social interactions.

    ## Developer Portal

    Developer Portal, a Teams app, helps you to sideload, configure, manage, test, publish, and distribute your app.

    ## Dive Deeper

    Choose to customize your app with user authentication and Microsoft Graph features.

    Now, you know about some features that Teams offers. Let's go back to the user story and see how you can use Teams features to build your app.

    Now that you've had a view of Teams offerings, you can map them to user needs. Let’s revisit the user scenario.

    ## App solution

    The developer from Tours and Travel agency wants to build an app for their users, the travelers. The app should:

    - Check and send the forecast to travelers registered with the travel agency.
    - Notify the users a day before the departure date so they can plan.

    Collate and map requirements to Teams features:

    | User app needs | Check forecast | Notification before travel | Registered user |
    | --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | **Capability** | Bot | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | **Integration** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Microsoft Graph; Forecast website |
    | **Scope** | &nbsp; | Personal app; Adaptive Card | &nbsp; |
    | **Integration point** | &nbsp; | Chat | &nbsp; |
    |

    **Teams app solution**: A Teams *personal chat bot* app, which checks and *sends forecast notification* in an *Adaptive Card* to *registered users* before their travel date, checks all requirements.

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/user-story-2.png" alt-text="Image showing user story" border="true":::

    Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution. To develop this app:

    1. Create a personal chat bot app.
    1. Integrate with external API from a forecast website to connect and request forecast for specific date and location.
    1. Integrate with Microsoft Graph for registered users.
    1. Check and send forecast details on the basis of users travel date and travel location on a particular day.
